# Bifrost documentation

## Architecture overview

Bifrost is an optimistic bridge that leverages Cardano Stake Pools high decentralization level to secure the peg-ins and peg-outs from and to other UTxO blockchains like Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin.
Because of the limited scripting capabilities of these blockchains, in recent years different bridging alternatives have been proposed. The current most known alternatives are FROST signatures of a small set of external nodes (Stacks), BitVM optimistic behaviour with 1-of-n honesty assumption with limited availability (Cardinal, Citrea) and Watchtower multisignature behaviour (Rosen Bridge).

Bifrost takes inspiration from all these solutions, but this time Cardano is used as a core component to guarantee the security and uncensorability of the user’s actions.

It then becomes easier to connect Cardano, a UTXO blockchain with smart contracts, to other smart contract blockchains and Layer 2s, making Cardano the central component of a safe bridging process.

The Cardano SPOs collectively become the responsible custodians of bridged assets on the original blockchain. For example, SPOs keep and manage the locked BTC on the Bitcoin side, while its bridged version fBTC circulates freely on Cardano.

Bifrost has been built to ensure security and availability, not speed or low costs.
In fact, Bifrost operations may take up to 1 or more Cardano epochs (an epoch is currently equals to 5 days), as coordination and heavy operations must be executed in the correct order.
The peg-ins and peg-outs also have to compensate for the work of all actors involved in Bifrost.
Therefore Bifrost should be used to move big amounts of liquidity in and out of Cardano and not for intra-day retail/small business operations.
Once big amounts of liquidity have been bridged to Cardano, for this type of smaller and frequent peg-ins and peg-outs it is possible to safely use services like FluidToken FluidSwaps, cutting costs and execution time without sacrificing security.

The security of Bifrost is guaranteed by SPOs participation: for a strong and reliable bridge, most of the top SPOs by delegation must participate in the protocol.

## Components

![Bifrost High Level Diagram](./images/Bifrost_HLD.png)
Bifrost setup is made by the following components:

* **Cardano**: the destination blockchain where bridged assets can safely participate in DeFi activities.
* **Source blockchain**: the original blockchain that contains assets to bridge to Cardano, like Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin.
* **Depositors**: users that lock their assets on the source blockchain to mint them on Cardano.
* **Withdrawers**: users that burn their bridged assets on Cardano to unlock them on the proper source blockchain.
* **Cardano Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)**: Cardano nodes that have delegated stake by Cardano users and that participate in Cardano consensus, guaranteeing its security.
* **Multisig treasury**: a script address on the source blockchain that holds all the bridged assets and it’s protected by a multisignature that only SPOs together can use. Each SPO has a weight equal to its delegation and a specific threshold of SPOs signature must be reached to spend/move the multisig treasury.
* **Watchtowers**: an open and always dynamic set of actors who have visibility on both Cardano and the source blockchain. They compete to post the most truthful source blockchain chain of blocks to the Binocular Oracle on Cardano. They also detect peg-in transactions on the source blockchain and post them as PegInRequest UTxOs on Cardano, and they relay SPO-signed Treasury Movement transactions from Cardano to the source blockchain. Anyone can become a Watchtower at any moment.

Bifrost logic is fully encapsulated in the following solutions:

* **SPOs program**: this code must run along with the usual SPO stack. It gives SPOs the ability to coordinate to sign Bitcoin transactions and the ability to see and interact with the needed Cardano smart contracts.
* **Watchtower program**: watchtowers run this software on top of source blockchain and Cardano nodes. It posts source blockchain block headers to the Binocular Oracle, detects peg-in transactions and posts PegInRequest UTxOs on Cardano, and relays SPO-signed Treasury Movement transactions to the source blockchain.
* Cardano smart contracts:
  * **spos_registry.ak**: SPOs that participate in Bifrost need to register here for the next upcoming epoch. The registry maintains the pool-scoped registration linked-list on-chain. Registration entries are keyed by `pool_id = blake2b_224(cold_vkey)` and store the authorized `bifrost_id_pk` and `bifrost_url` used by the off-chain SPO protocol.
  * **spo_bans.ak**: maintains the pool-scoped ban linked-list on-chain. It consumes verified direct-fault tokens from an allow-list of fault verifier policies and applies time-based ban updates.
  * **fault_verifier.ak**: mock verifier policy for direct SPO fault evidence. Production uses separate verifier policies for DKG Round 1 faults, DKG Round 2 faults, and equivocation faults. Other scripts, including `spo_bans.ak`, consume the resulting tokens instead of re-verifying the raw evidence.
  * **Binocular**: The watchtowers (anyone) post the best chain of blocks here, other watchtowers eventually challenge it by posting a better version and the winner gets rewarded by the end of the availability window.
  * **peg_in.ak**: watchtowers (or anyone) create PegInRequest UTxOs here by minting a PegInRequest NFT and providing a Binocular inclusion proof of the Bitcoin deposit transaction. The datum contains the raw Bitcoin peg-in transaction bytes. SPOs do not have direct access to Bitcoin chain state, so PegInRequest UTxOs serve as their trusted source of Bitcoin deposit data for constructing Treasury Movement transactions.
  * **peg_out.ak**: when a withdrawer wants to unlock the bridged assets on the proper source blockchain, he locks his bridged assets at this smart contract. The datum contains the source blockchain destination address where assets should be sent. SPOs read these UTxOs to include peg-out payments in the Treasury Movement transaction.
  * **treasury.ak**: stores the Treasury state UTxO. It carries the currently available Treasury FROST group public keys (for the 51% mode after DKG completes), the federation fallback key $Y_{federation}$, a Merkle Patricia Trie of completed peg-ins, and a second Merkle Patricia Trie root for active Bifrost identity bindings `bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id`. Depositors and validators read the completed-peg-ins trie and the current Treasury keys to derive valid spend/mint paths. Registration and revocation transactions update the Bifrost-identity trie root to preserve global uniqueness of active Bifrost keys. For the first epoch, the initial Treasury public keys and trie roots are set during protocol bootstrap.
  * **treasury_movement.ak**: SPOs post signed source blockchain Treasury Movement transactions here. The datum contains the serialized signed transaction, the epoch number, and references to the PegInRequest and PegOut UTxOs it covers. Watchtowers monitor this contract and relay the signed transactions to the source blockchain.
  * **bridged_asset.ak**: minting and burning of bridged assets (e.g. fBTC). The depositor mints fBTC by spending the PegInRequest UTxO and providing: a Binocular inclusion proof of the confirmed Treasury Movement transaction, a reference to the corresponding `treasury_movement.ak` UTxO (to verify the confirmed transaction matches what SPOs signed and posted), a non-inclusion proof against the completed peg-ins Merkle Patricia Trie in `treasury.ak` (preventing double minting), their Bitcoin x-only public key, and a Schnorr signature proving ownership. The validator verifies the Binocular-confirmed txid matches the `treasury_movement.ak` datum (proving the confirmed transaction matches what was posted by the protocol's signing cascade), parses the raw TM transaction to verify the depositor's peg-in txid+vout appears as an input (proving the Treasury Movement actually swept the deposit), parses the raw peg-in transaction from the PegInRequest datum to extract the depositor_pubkey_hash from the OP_RETURN and the deposit amount, verifies HASH160(pubkey) matches the depositor_pubkey_hash, checks the signature via `verifySchnorrSecp256k1Signature`, verifies the peg-in is not already in the completed trie, and mints the correct amount of fBTC to whatever Cardano address the depositor specifies in the transaction outputs. The minting transaction also inserts the peg-in into the completed peg-ins trie in the Treasury UTxO. Anyone can burn fBTC for a peg-out by spending the PegOut UTxO and providing a Binocular inclusion proof of the Treasury Movement transaction that fulfilled the peg-out.

## Components relationships

![Bifrost Flow Chart](./images/Bifrost_flow_chart.png)

Watchtowers, who run the watchtower program, challenge each other to be the first to post the best source blockchain chain of valid blocks in the Binocular Oracle smart contract. The winner for each chain is rewarded with some ADA, proportionally for each valid block posted.

Depositors, who want to peg-in, send their source blockchain assets to a unique Taproot address with an OP_RETURN metadata marker identifying the transaction as a Bifrost peg-in. They then create PegInRequest UTxOs on Cardano (peg_in.ak) by minting an NFT and providing an inclusion proof. The PegInRequest UTxO creation could be potentially delegated to automated services but fundamentally the depositors have full control of this process.

Withdrawers, who want to peg-out, lock their bridged assets (e.g. fBTC) at peg_out.ak, specifying their source blockchain destination address in the datum.

SPOs, who register with their delegated stake to join the next epoch in spos_registry.ak, are identified on-chain by their cold-key-derived `pool_id` and authorize a separate Bifrost Secp256k1 identity key for DKG and signing communication. The registration is accepted only if the SPO has a delegated stake bigger than a minimum threshold.

At the end of each epoch, the registered SPOs (that normally also include the old group) verify each other's delegated stake to ensure honesty and participate in a DKG ceremony to generate their new shared multisignature address.

The old SPOs group then constructs a Treasury Movement transaction on the source blockchain. All quorum levels target the same **full** peg-in/peg-out batch and treasury move:

* Spends the current treasury UTxO, sending remaining funds to the new SPOs Treasury address.
* Collects (spends) all confirmed peg-in UTxOs, consolidating them into the treasury.
* Sends the correct amounts from the treasury to the source blockchain addresses that have correctly requested a peg-out.

The signing cascade tries the SPO threshold first, then falls back to the federation:

1. **51% quorum ($Y_{51}$, main line)**: SPOs sign via the $Y_{51}$ key path — the cheapest spending path. This is the primary operating mode.
2. **Federation ($Y_{federation}$, emergency)**: if the 51% mode does not yield a usable signature within its bounded setup and signing phases, the federation signs via the $Y_{federation}$ script leaf with timelock.

If the resulting transaction would be too large, SPOs may split it into multiple transactions.

In the 51% mode, the SPOs sign this transaction using FROST group signing and post the serialized signed transaction to Cardano (treasury_movement.ak). In the federation mode, the federation signs via the $Y_{federation}$ script path with timelock and the resulting signed transaction is posted to Cardano the same way. Watchtowers monitor treasury_movement.ak, pick up the signed transaction, and broadcast it to the source blockchain network.

Once the Treasury Movement transaction is confirmed on the source blockchain, the bridging operations can be completed on Cardano:

* For peg-ins: the depositor spends the PegInRequest UTxO and provides a Binocular inclusion proof of the confirmed Treasury Movement transaction and a reference to the corresponding `treasury_movement.ak` UTxO — the validator verifies the confirmed txid matches the posted datum, proving the confirmed transaction matches what was posted by the protocol's signing cascade (not, e.g., a depositor timeout reclaim). The validator parses the raw TM transaction to verify the depositor's peg-in txid+vout appears as an input (proving the TM actually swept this deposit), and parses the raw peg-in transaction from the PegInRequest datum to extract the depositor_pubkey_hash and deposit amount. The depositor additionally provides a non-inclusion proof against the completed peg-ins Merkle Patricia Trie in the Treasury UTxO, their Bitcoin x-only public key, and a Schnorr signature proving ownership. This mints the corresponding fBTC to a Cardano address of the depositor's choice and inserts the peg-in into the completed peg-ins trie to prevent double minting.
* For peg-outs: anyone spends the PegOut UTxO and provides a Binocular inclusion proof of the Treasury Movement transaction that fulfilled the peg-out, burning the locked fBTC and retrieving the min_utxo ADA.

Peg-out completion is fully permissionless. Peg-in completion requires the depositor's action (Schnorr signature), which gives the depositor full control over the Cardano destination address.

### Cardano and Bitcoin transaction flow

![Bifrost UTxO Flow](./images/utxo_flow.png)

## User peg-in flow

Let's use Bitcoin as example.
A user who wants to move his BTC from Bitcoin to Cardano is called a depositor.
These are the steps to execute a correct peg-in:

* Check the status of Bifrost: if the bridge is correctly operational and we are not too near the end of the current Cardano epoch, the peg-in can be done.
* Retrieve the current Treasury key $Y_{51}$ from `treasury.ak` on Cardano (published there after each DKG).
* On Bitcoin, send the amount of BTC to peg-in to a Taproot address derived from $Y_{51}$, the federation fallback script, and the depositor's timeout refund script (see **Taproot address construction** below). The address has three spending paths: the $Y_{51}$ key path (for SPO sweep — main line), a $Y_{federation}$ script leaf (for federation emergency sweep after timeout), and a script leaf allowing the depositor to reclaim after ~30 days. The transaction must include an OP_RETURN output containing: `"BFR" || depositor_pubkey_hash (20 bytes)` (23 bytes total). The `depositor_pubkey_hash` is HASH160 of the depositor's Bitcoin x-only public key and is needed by SPOs to reconstruct the Taproot address and compute the tweak for key-path signing.
* Wait for watchtowers to detect the Bitcoin transaction, post the corresponding Bitcoin block to the Binocular Oracle, and create a PegInRequest UTxO on Cardano (peg_in.ak) by minting a PegInRequest NFT and providing a transaction inclusion proof.
* Wait for the peg-in to be included in the Treasury Movement transaction at the next epoch boundary. In the normal 51% mode, SPOs sign this transaction with FROST and post it to Cardano (`treasury_movement.ak`); in the emergency mode, the federation satisfies the $Y_{federation}$ fallback script path instead. Watchtowers then relay the signed transaction to Bitcoin.
* Once the Treasury Movement transaction is confirmed on Bitcoin, the depositor completes the peg-in on Cardano by spending the PegInRequest UTxO and providing: a Binocular inclusion proof of the confirmed Treasury Movement transaction, a reference to the corresponding `treasury_movement.ak` UTxO (the validator verifies the confirmed txid matches the posted datum, proving the confirmed transaction matches what was posted by the protocol's signing cascade), a non-inclusion proof against the completed peg-ins Merkle Patricia Trie in the Treasury UTxO (preventing double minting), their Bitcoin x-only public key, and a Schnorr signature proving ownership. The validator parses the raw TM transaction to verify the depositor's peg-in txid+vout appears as an input (confirming the Treasury Movement actually swept this deposit), and parses the raw peg-in transaction from the PegInRequest datum to extract the depositor_pubkey_hash and deposit amount (this is the only point where the peg-in transaction is parsed on-chain). This mints the correct amount of fBTC to whatever Cardano address the depositor chooses and inserts the peg-in into the completed peg-ins trie in the Treasury UTxO.
* If the peg-in was not included in the Treasury Movement transaction (e.g., it arrived too late in the epoch), it rolls over to the next epoch. If the Treasury key has rotated and the peg-in can no longer be swept, the depositor uses the ~30-day timeout spending path to reclaim their BTC and can retry with the new Treasury address.
* **PegInRequest closure**: A PegInRequest UTxO can be closed (NFT burned, min_utxo ADA reclaimed by the creator) under two conditions:
  * **After depositor timeout reclaim**: the creator provides a Binocular inclusion proof of a confirmed Bitcoin transaction that spends the peg-in txid+vout via the **depositor refund script leaf** (not the federation leaf, not the key path). The on-chain validator parses the Bitcoin transaction witness to verify it is a script-path spend using the depositor refund script specifically, not a key-path spend (which would be an SPO sweep) or a federation script-path spend (which would also be a legitimate sweep). This ensures closure cannot grief a depositor whose funds were legitimately swept by either SPOs or the federation.
  * **Duplicate PegInRequest**: the creator provides a **trie inclusion proof** showing the peg-in is already in the completed peg-ins Merkle Patricia Trie in the Treasury UTxO. This means fBTC was already minted via another PegInRequest for the same deposit, so this one is redundant.

### Taproot address construction

The Treasury address and peg-in addresses use different Taproot trees following BIP341 [4]. Both use $Y_{51}$ as the key-path internal key, making the 51% FROST threshold the main-line operating mode. The federation appears as a timelock-gated fallback script leaf in both trees.

#### Keys

- $Y_{51}$ is the FROST group public key produced by DKG with a threshold ensuring any signing subset controls more than 51% of delegated stake. It is stored in `treasury.ak`.
- $Y_{federation}$ is a known protocol parameter — a public key controlled by a federation of trusted entities, used only as a last-resort spending path.

#### Treasury Taproot tree

The Treasury address (holding consolidated funds) uses $Y_{51}$ as the key-path internal key, with a single emergency fallback script leaf:

| Path        | Key              | Condition     | Use case                              |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Key path    | $Y_{51}$         | Immediate     | Normal operation (main line): full TM |
| Script leaf | $Y_{federation}$ | After timeout | Emergency fallback: full TM           |

Script leaf (federation rescue):
```
<timeout_federation> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <Y_federation> OP_CHECKSIG
```

Merkle tree (single leaf):
```
     root
       |
  Y_federation
```

Treasury output key: `Q_treasury = Y_51 + tagged_hash("TapTweak", Y_51 || merkle_root) · G`

This address changes each epoch after DKG, since $Y_{51}$ is regenerated.

SPOs spend the treasury via the $Y_{51}$ key path — a single 64-byte Schnorr signature with no script reveal, the cheapest spending path. In emergency (federation), the $Y_{federation}$ script path with timelock is used.

#### Peg-in Taproot tree

The peg-in address uses $Y_{51}$ as the key-path internal key (for SPO sweep — main line), with a federation emergency sweep leaf and a depositor refund leaf:

| Path          | Key              | Condition                    | Use case                   |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Key path | $Y_{51}$ | Immediate | SPO sweep (main line) |
| Script leaf 1 | $Y_{federation}$ | After timeout | Federation emergency sweep |
| Script leaf 2 | Depositor | After ~30 days (4320 blocks) | Depositor self-refund |

Script leaf 1 (federation emergency sweep):
```
<timeout_federation> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <Y_federation> OP_CHECKSIG
```

Script leaf 2 (depositor refund, P2PKH-style):
```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <depositor_pubkey_hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <4320> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
```

`depositor_pubkey_hash` is HASH160 of the depositor's Bitcoin x-only public key (20 bytes). 4320 blocks ≈ 30 days. At spend time, the depositor provides their full x-only pubkey in the witness; the script verifies the hash matches before checking the signature.

Merkle tree (2 leaves):
```
      root
     /    \
  Y_fed   depositor_refund
```

The peg-in output key $Q$ is:

`Q = Y_51 + tagged_hash("TapTweak", Y_51 || merkle_root) · G`

Where:

- $Y_{51}$ is the internal key (51% FROST group x-only public key, from `treasury.ak`).
- The script tree contains two leaves (federation sweep and depositor refund), so merkle_root is the hash of both leaf hashes.
- `leaf_hash = tagged_hash("TapLeaf", 0xc0 || compact_size(script_len) || script)`
- `tagged_hash(tag, msg) = SHA256(SHA256(tag) || SHA256(tag) || msg)`
- $G$ is the secp256k1 generator point.

The resulting Bitcoin address is `bc1p<bech32m(Q)>`.

**To reconstruct $Q$**, all components are available: $Y_{51}$ and $Y_{federation}$ from `treasury.ak`, and the depositor's pubkey hash from the OP_RETURN (propagated via the PegInRequest datum). Both scripts are fully determined by these parameters — no secret information is needed.

#### Spending paths and Treasury Movement variants

Both quorum levels construct **full** Treasury Movement transactions (sweeping peg-in UTxOs, fulfilling peg-outs, and moving the treasury). The signing cascade tries the SPO threshold first, then falls back to the federation:

**Key path on Treasury, key path on peg-in inputs (51% quorum — main line):**

SPOs collect all confirmed PegInRequest and PegOut UTxOs from Cardano and construct a full Treasury Movement transaction. They spend both the treasury UTxO and the peg-in UTxOs via key path ($Y_{51}$) — a single 64-byte FROST Schnorr signature per input. To sign peg-in inputs, SPOs compute the tweaked private key: `d = y_51 + tagged_hash("TapTweak", Y_51 || merkle_root)`, where $y_{51}$ is the FROST group private key (held as shares). Computing the merkle_root requires the depositor's pubkey hash (for the refund leaf) and $Y_{federation}$ (for the federation leaf) — both available from the PegInRequest datum and `treasury.ak`. This is the cheapest spending path.

**Script path on Treasury, script path on peg-in inputs (federation — emergency):**

If the 51% mode does not yield a usable threshold signature within its bounded setup and signing phases, the federation signs a Treasury Movement transaction for the same peg-in/peg-out batch and treasury move, using the witness structure required by the $Y_{federation}$ script leaf with CSV timelock on all relevant inputs.

**Script path on peg-in only (depositor refund):**

After ~30 days (4320 blocks), the depositor reveals the depositor refund script and control block to reclaim their BTC. This protects depositors if the bridge fails to process their peg-in (e.g., Treasury key rotated before sweep).

#### Taproot address verification

Plutus V3 does not expose secp256k1 point arithmetic builtins (only `verifySchnorrSecp256k1Signature` and `verifyEcdsaSecp256k1Signature`), so `peg_in.ak` **cannot** reconstruct $Q$ from $Y_{51}$, $Y_{federation}$, and the depositor's script on-chain.

Instead, Taproot address correctness is verified **off-chain by SPOs**: before including a peg-in in the Treasury Movement transaction, each SPO independently reconstructs the expected peg-in Taproot address from $Y_{51}$, $Y_{federation}$, and the depositor's pubkey hash (read from the PegInRequest datum), and verifies it matches the Bitcoin transaction output. SPOs will not sign a Treasury Movement transaction that spends UTxOs they cannot actually spend.

This design is safe because:

- **No fund risk**: if a PegInRequest references an incorrectly constructed Taproot address, SPOs simply skip it. The depositor reclaims via the timeout path.
- **No theft risk**: fBTC is only minted after the Treasury Movement transaction (which sweeps the peg-in) is confirmed on Bitcoin. A fake PegInRequest that SPOs skip will never lead to fBTC minting.
- **Griefing cost**: creating a fake PegInRequest costs the attacker the NFT minting fee and min_utxo ADA, with no benefit.

## User peg-out flow

Let's use Bitcoin as example.
A user who wants to move his BTC from Cardano to Bitcoin is called a withdrawer.
These are the steps to execute a correct peg-out:

* Check the status of Bifrost: if the bridge is correctly operational and we are not too near the end of the current Cardano epoch, the peg-out can be done.
* On Cardano, lock the correct amount of fBTC plus MIN_ADA at the peg_out.ak spend script, minting a unique NFT. The datum contains the Bitcoin destination address where BTC should be sent.
* Wait for the peg-out to be included in the Treasury Movement transaction at the next epoch boundary. In the normal 51% mode, SPOs sign this transaction with FROST and post it to Cardano (`treasury_movement.ak`); in the emergency mode, the federation satisfies the $Y_{federation}$ fallback script path instead. Watchtowers then relay the signed transaction to Bitcoin. At this point, the withdrawer has received BTC at their specified Bitcoin address.
* Once the Treasury Movement transaction is confirmed on Bitcoin (100 Bitcoin blocks for Binocular confirmation), anyone can complete the peg-out on Cardano by providing a Binocular inclusion proof of the Treasury Movement transaction. This burns the locked fBTC and the peg-out NFT, returning the MIN_ADA to the withdrawer.
* If for unexpected reasons the Treasury Movement transaction did not include the peg-out payment, the withdrawer can use a Binocular exclusion proof to unlock their fBTC and try again in the next epoch.

## Transaction catalog

This section is the normative reference for every on-chain transaction the protocol uses. Each entry pairs a Mermaid diagram (visual shape) with a structured table (inputs / reference inputs / mint / outputs / redeemers / validity / signers) and the on-chain checks enforced by the relevant validator.

### Peg-in deposit (Bitcoin)

**Purpose**: lock BTC at a Bifrost peg-in Taproot address, making it sweepable by the next Treasury Movement. This is a plain Bitcoin transaction — Bitcoin consensus enforces nothing Bifrost-specific; the protocol meaning comes from the output shape and the OP_RETURN marker.

**Who**: the depositor.
**Trigger**: the depositor decides to bridge BTC → fBTC.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  dep_in["Depositor BTC UTxOs"] --> tx{{"Peg-in deposit (Bitcoin)"}}
  tx --> pegin["Peg-in UTxO<br/>@ Taproot Q<br/>(paths: Y₅₁ key · Y_fed+CSV · refund)"]
  tx --> opret["OP_RETURN<br/>BFR ‖ depositor_pkh"]
  tx --> change["Change → depositor"]
```

**Structure**

| Role | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Depositor BTC UTxOs — funds the peg-in amount + BTC fees |
| **Outputs** | Peg-in UTxO at Taproot address $Q$ (holds the BTC to be bridged); OP_RETURN `"BFR" ‖ depositor_pubkey_hash` (23 bytes); optional change → depositor |
| **Signer** | depositor (their Bitcoin keys) |
| **Validity** | standard Bitcoin transaction |
| **Size (est.)** | ~220 vB (1 P2WPKH input + 3 outputs: P2TR peg-in ~43 B, OP_RETURN ~34 B, P2WPKH change ~31 B) |

**Taproot address $Q$** (see **Taproot address construction** for the full derivation)

`Q = Y_51 + tagged_hash("TapTweak", Y_51 || merkle_root) · G`

where the script tree has two leaves:

* `Y_federation + CSV` — federation emergency sweep after timeout;
* depositor refund — spendable by the depositor after ~4320 blocks (~30 days).

Key path ($Y_{51}$) is the main line: it is how SPOs sweep this UTxO into the next Treasury Movement.

**What Bitcoin enforces**: standard tx validity (input signatures, fees, output scripts well-formed). Nothing Bifrost-specific.

**What the depositor must get right** (no party will save them otherwise)

* $Q$ is constructed from the **current** $Y_{51}$ published in `treasury.ak` and $Y_{federation}$. Using a stale $Y_{51}$ makes the peg-in unsweepable — the depositor must then wait out the ~30-day refund.
* OP_RETURN must be present and equal `BFR ‖ depositor_pubkey_hash`, otherwise watchtowers will not detect the deposit and no PegInRequest will ever be created.
* `depositor_pubkey_hash` must match the depositor's actual x-only pubkey (HASH160), otherwise the 30-day refund leaf cannot be spent.

### Create PegInRequest (Cardano)

**Purpose**: publish on Cardano the claim "a Bitcoin peg-in deposit is confirmed; here is the raw BTC tx and a proof it sits in the confirmed chain", so SPOs can read it when building the next Treasury Movement.

**Who**: anyone — typically a watchtower, or the depositor themselves.
**Trigger**: the block containing the BTC peg-in deposit has passed the Binocular confirmation window (≥100 Bitcoin blocks + 200 min challenge).

A single tx may create **N PegInRequests at once** (batching). The mint redeemer carries a list; the validator checks each entry independently.

```mermaid

  tx --> change["Change → creator"]
```

**Structure**

| Role | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Creator UTxO — fees + N × MIN_ADA |
| **Reference inputs** | Binocular Oracle state — supplies the confirmed-chain root |
| **Mint** | +N PegInRequest NFTs (one per request; each with a unique on-chain identity) |
| **Outputs** | N × PegInRequest UTxO — each holds one NFT + MIN_ADA; datum = `{ raw BTC peg-in tx, owner_auth }` |
| **Witness data (redeemer)** | for each of the N requests: Merkle proof BTC tx ∈ block header; Merkle proof block header ∈ Binocular confirmed-chain root |
| **Validity interval** | unconstrained |
| **Size (est.)** | ~2 KB for N=1; up to ~16 KB for N=10 (batch ceiling). See **Size estimation and batch ceiling** below. |

**Checks enforced on-chain** (per minted NFT, independently)

* The supplied BTC tx is Merkle-included in the supplied BTC block header.
* That block header is included in Binocular's confirmed-chain root.
* The NFT is minted uniquely and paired with exactly one output carrying the declared datum.

**Checks delegated to SPOs off-chain** (Plutus V3 cannot do secp256k1 point arithmetic, so these are verified before signing the TM)

* The BTC output pays a valid Bifrost peg-in Taproot address (reconstructed from $Y_{51}$, $Y_{federation}$, and the depositor's pubkey hash).
* The OP_RETURN marker equals `BFR ‖ depositor_pubkey_hash`.
* The claimed peg-in amount matches the BTC output amount.

If any off-chain check fails, SPOs skip this PegInRequest. No fund risk, no theft risk — griefing cost = NFT minting fee + MIN_ADA.

**PegInDatum**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `owner_auth` | `AuthorizationMethod` | authority that can later `Cancel` this request |
| `source_chain_peg_in_raw_tx` | `ByteArray` | raw BTC peg-in tx bytes — SPOs parse everything they need (output UTxO, amount, depositor pubkey) from here |

**Size estimation and batch ceiling**

Per-request payload:

| Part | Where | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| raw BTC peg-in tx | output datum | ~400 B |
| `owner_auth` | output datum | ~48 B |
| BTC block header | mint redeemer | 80 B |
| MPT inclusion proof (header ∈ confirmed chain) | mint redeemer | ~600 B |
| Bitcoin Merkle proof (tx ∈ block) | mint redeemer | ~320 B |
| NFT (asset name + qty, in mint + output value) | tx body | ~50 B |
| Output overhead (address + value bag wrapper) | tx body | ~60 B |
| **Per-request total** | | **~1.56 KB** |

Fixed per-tx overhead (creator input, oracle reference input, change output, signature, tx header, script integrity hash): **~400 B**.

At ~1.56 KB per request, byte size caps a batch at **~10 requests per tx** before hitting Cardano's 16 KB limit. Execution-unit memory (~14 M) is expected to converge on the same ~10-per-batch ceiling — per-request exec cost is dominated by the MPT + Merkle proof verifications and scales linearly.

Fee comparison (mainnet params: $a = 0.155$ ADA, $b = 4.4 \times 10^{-5}$ ADA/byte; exec: $7.21 \times 10^{-5}$ ADA/step, $5.77 \times 10^{-2}$ ADA/mem):

| Scenario | Byte fee | Exec fee | Total |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 request per tx | ~0.24 ADA | ~0.09 ADA | **~0.33 ADA** |
| 10 requests batched | ~0.86 ADA | ~0.72 ADA | **~1.58 ADA** |
| 10 requests, 1 per tx | ~2.40 ADA | ~0.90 ADA | **~3.30 ADA** |

Batching 10 saves ~1.7 ADA (~50%) — meaningful at scale but not load-bearing. Watchtowers MAY batch up to 10 PegInRequests in a single tx.

### Create PegOut request (Cardano)

**Purpose**: lock fBTC on Cardano together with a Bitcoin destination, so the next Treasury Movement can pay out.

**Who**: the withdrawer.
**Trigger**: the withdrawer wants to bridge fBTC → BTC.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  wdraw["Withdrawer UTxO<br/>fBTC + ADA"] --> tx{{"Create PegOut request"}}
  tx --> pout["PegOut UTxO @ peg_out.ak<br/>fBTC + MIN_ADA<br/>datum: { btc_dest_scriptPubKey, owner_auth }"]
  tx --> change["Change → withdrawer"]
```

**Structure**

| Role | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Withdrawer UTxO — holds the fBTC to lock + ADA for fees + MIN_ADA |
| **Reference inputs** | — |
| **Mint** | — |
| **Outputs** | PegOut UTxO @ `peg_out.ak` — holds the locked fBTC + MIN_ADA; datum = `{ btc_destination_scriptPubKey, owner_auth }` |
| **Witness data (redeemer)** | — (a plain payment to a script address; the validator runs only on spend) |
| **Validity interval** | unconstrained |
| **Size (est.)** | ~0.5 KB (no script execution; fee ≈ 0.18 ADA) |

**Checks enforced on-chain**

* None at creation — `peg_out.ak` is a spend-only validator, so creation is just a standard output. The withdrawer is the only one harmed by a malformed PegOut.

**Checks delegated off-chain**

* `btc_destination_scriptPubKey` is a valid, spendable Bitcoin script. If it is malformed, the TM output is unspendable and the BTC is effectively lost — there is no on-chain proof possible.

**PegOutDatum**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `btc_destination_scriptPubKey` | `ByteArray` | raw BTC output script where the TM pays |
| `owner_auth` | `AuthorizationMethod` | authority that can reclaim fBTC if the TM excludes this peg-out |

The peg-out **amount** is simply the fBTC quantity held in the UTxO's value — no separate datum field needed.

### Treasury Movement (Bitcoin)

**Purpose**: in a single Bitcoin transaction, sweep every confirmed peg-in into the treasury, pay every pending peg-out, and move the treasury to the next-epoch roster's Taproot address.

**Who**: current roster of SPOs via FROST group signing — or the federation, in emergency.
**Trigger**: end-of-epoch signing cascade.

```mermaid

```

**Structure**

| Role | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Current Treasury BTC UTxO + all confirmed peg-in UTxOs (identified by `peg_in_utxo_id` in each PegInRequest) |
| **Outputs** | New Treasury UTxO at the new roster's $Q_{treasury}$ + one payment output per PegOut (pays `btc_destination_scriptPubKey` with `amount`) |
| **Witness** | FROST aggregated Schnorr signature(s) per the chosen variant |
| **Validity** | CSV timelock enforced on inputs only in the federation variant |
| **Size (est.)** | **Hard-capped at ~15 KB raw bytes** — the signed TM is carried in the Cardano Post-TM datum, which must fit the 16 KB Cardano tx limit. Per-variant max batch: ~100 peg-ins + ~100 peg-outs (51% key-path, ~107 B/input); ~57+57 (federation — script-path + CSV on every input, ~213 B/input). Beyond these, SPOs split across multiple TMs (see line above). |

**Signing-path variants** (chosen by the signing cascade; see **Spending paths and Treasury Movement variants**)

| Variant | Treasury input via | Peg-in inputs via | Chosen when |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **51% main line** | $Y_{51}$ key path | $Y_{51}$ key path | 51% quorum produced a valid aggregate signature |
| **Federation emergency** | $Y_{federation}$ script leaf + CSV | $Y_{federation}$ script leaf + CSV | 51% mode exhausted |

**What Bitcoin enforces**: standard Taproot verification per the chosen path. Nothing Bifrost-specific.

**What SPOs / federation must get right off-chain**

* The batch covers exactly the frozen set of PegInRequests and PegOuts for this epoch (determinism — every honest SPO must build the same unsigned tx).
* Each peg-in input is spendable via a path the signer actually controls.
* Each PegOut payment matches the destination and amount in its datum.

If the TM is malformed or omits a peg-out, recovery paths on Cardano unwind the state in the next epoch.

### Post signed TM as `Unconfirmed TM tx` (Cardano)

**Purpose**: publish the signed Bitcoin TM transaction on Cardano so watchtowers can relay it to Bitcoin. This creates the TM UTxO in its initial `Unconfirmed` state — **not** yet usable by mint-fBTC or burn-fBTC, which only reference `Confirmed TM tx` (produced later by the Confirm TM tx transition).

**Who**: a current-roster SPO (typically the elected leader, per the leader-election rule).
**Trigger**: the signing cascade produced a valid signed Bitcoin tx.

* Poster is a member of the current roster (looked up via `treasury.ak`).
* Leader-election rule permits this SPO to post at the current slot.

**Checks delegated off-chain**

* `signed_btc_tx` is a well-formed Bitcoin tx with valid signatures that sweeps the frozen PegInRequest / PegOut batch. If malformed, it fails to confirm on Bitcoin and Confirm TM tx never fires — a correct resubmission is required. The peg-in and peg-out sets are implicit in `signed_btc_tx` (Confirm TM tx parses them out).

### Confirm TM tx (Cardano)

**Purpose**: once the posted TM is confirmed on Bitcoin, transition the TM UTxO from `Unconfirmed` to `Confirmed`. This is the one place the Binocular proof is checked; every downstream mint-fBTC / burn-fBTC reads `Confirmed TM tx` and skips Binocular entirely. Confirm TM tx does **not** touch `treasury.ak`: key rotation is done in a separate Update-Y transaction after DKG, and the current treasury BTC UTxO pointer is tracked off-chain by SPOs.

**Who**: anyone — typically a watchtower.
**Trigger**: the TM is Binocular-confirmed (≥100 Bitcoin blocks + 200 min challenge).

* `blake2b(Unconfirmed.signed_btc_tx) == btc_txid` (identifies the tx we're confirming).
* `btc_txid` is Merkle-included in the supplied block header.
* That block header is in Binocular's confirmed-chain root.
* `Confirmed` datum fields (`swept_peg_in_utxo_ids`, `fulfilled_peg_outs`) are populated by parsing the inputs and outputs of `Unconfirmed.signed_btc_tx` respectively. The old treasury input and the new treasury output are included in these lists — they are inert, because no PegInRequest can satisfy the depositor Schnorr-sig check against the TM tx's inputs (no `BFR` OP_RETURN), and no PegOut will match the new treasury destination + amount.
* TM NFT is carried from the Unconfirmed input to the Confirmed output (preserving identity).

Confirmed UTxOs are drained (and can eventually be garbage-collected) once every claimable peg-in in `swept_peg_in_utxo_ids` has been minted and every peg-out in `fulfilled_peg_outs` has been burned.

### Complete peg-in / mint fBTC (Cardano)

**Checks enforced on-chain**

* Referenced `Confirmed TM tx` UTxO carries a legitimate TM NFT.
* PegInRequest's `peg_in_utxo_id` appears in `Confirmed.swept_peg_in_utxo_ids`.
* Depositor's Schnorr signature is valid over the **per-mint signing message**, using the x-only pubkey recorded in the PegInRequest datum (`user_source_chain_pub_key`). At PegInRequest **mint** time that key — together with `peg_in_utxo_id` and `peg_in_amount` — is bound to the depositor's *actual* deposit: the mint handler checks they match a real P2TR output of the block-confirmed deposit tx and the x-only key committed in that deposit's `BFR` OP_RETURN (`bitcoin.deposit_binding_ok`). *This is what proves the depositor — not a watchtower — is claiming the fBTC.*

  The signing message is a `sha2_256` hash of:

  ```
  sig_msg = "BFR-mint-v1" ‖ Confirmed.btc_txid ‖ peg_in_utxo_id ‖ chosen_cardano_address
  ```

  * `"BFR-mint-v1"` — domain-separation tag (BIP340 practice).
  * `peg_in_utxo_id` — binds the signature to **this specific peg-in**. Without it, if a depositor reused the same BTC pubkey across multiple peg-ins in the same TM, publishing the signature to claim one would let an attacker replay it to claim the others.
  * `chosen_cardano_address` — binds the signature to the **destination the depositor chose**. Prevents reorg-based front-running where an attacker replays the signature with their own Cardano address after a short chain reorganisation of the depositor's mint tx.
* Peg-in is **not yet** in the completed-peg-ins MPT (non-inclusion proof).
* Peg-in **is** in the new MPT root in the output (prevents double-mint).
* fBTC minted equals the amount parsed from the raw BTC peg-in tx.
* PegInRequest NFT is burned.

### Complete peg-out / burn fBTC (Cardano)

## Guaranteeing censor-resistant peg-ins and peg-outs

The main axiom is: When the user uses any bridge, he is already fully trusting the source (ex. Bitcoin) and the destination (ex. Cardano). Every additional component that the bridge uses and that it can't be under direct control of the user is an additional trust assumption.

Bifrost is truly trustless only if it doesn't necessarily add new trust assumptions.
As long as the Cardano SPOs and the watchtowers are collaborative, each peg-in or peg-out is permissionless: no actor exists who can decide if the user is permitted to move his assets between the blockchains.

Therefore, the potential additional trust assumptions in Bifrost are the Cardano SPOs and the watchtowers:

* Even if the user becomes a Cardano SPO, he would be just a small part of the total weight-based set of SPOs. Luckily, the strong majority of the SPOs are always incentivized in behaving correctly and on time, like they do when they participate in block-production consensus on Cardano. In fact, the security of Bifrost directly impacts their revenue model: more assets moved with Bifrost imply more Cardano transactions and an increase of the ADA price caused by the bigger demand to execute these transactions. Cardano SPOs want the bridge to work well because their revenue stream strongly depends on it.
* Watchtowers are an "always open" set of nodes that challenge each other to post on Cardano the best chain of blocks from the source blockchains (ex. from Bitcoin), and also detect and post peg-in requests on Cardano. While the watchtowers earn rewards for doing this job, they could potentially collude and stop posting blocks or peg-in requests, halting the bridge for an unbounded timeframe. In this case the user who wants to peg-in or peg-out can spin up a watchtower himself and post the source blockchain blocks starting from the latest confirmed ones, and create their own PegInRequest UTxOs on Cardano. Because every user is able to become a watchtower at any time, there will be a safe challenge among them to post the correct chain of blocks, resuming the Bifrost operations even in case of collusion. The completion of peg-outs (burning fBTC) is fully permissionless: anyone can submit the required Binocular inclusion proofs to finalize. For peg-ins, the depositor completes the minting themselves by providing a Binocular inclusion proof and a Schnorr signature with their Bitcoin key, choosing their Cardano destination address at mint time. No third party can censor or redirect a depositor's fBTC.

## Rollout Phases

Bifrost supports a phased rollout from federated to fully decentralized operation:

**Phase 1 — Federation Launch**: The bridge launches with the federation as the only signing entity. SPOs begin registering. The federation key is the $Y_{federation}$ used in the Taproot fallback path. During this phase, all Treasury Movement transactions are signed via the federation script path with timelock.

**Phase 2 — 51% SPO Participation**: Once sufficient SPOs have registered and completed DKG, the 51% FROST threshold becomes operational. SPOs sign via key path ($Y_{51}$), and the federation becomes an emergency-only fallback. This is the "main line" operating mode — the protocol's terminal steady-state.

## Flow of Bitcoin over epochs, ceremonies

![Epoch lifecycle Gantt diagram](images/epoch_lifecycle.png)

The diagram above shows two consecutive Cardano epochs with roster handoff from Roster A to Roster B. SPO registration and deregistration is continuous — a registry snapshot is taken at each epoch boundary along with the stake distribution from epoch N−1 (which will become N−2 when the new roster operates). Within each epoch the following phases occur:

1. **Registry Snapshot + Stake Distribution** — at the epoch boundary, the candidate set is locked and stake weights are read from the previous epoch's distribution.
2. **Peg-in / peg-out requests open** — users submit bridging requests during the first ~36 hours of the epoch.
3. **DKG** (new roster, off-chain) — the incoming roster runs distributed key generation to produce the group key $Y_{51}$, running concurrently with the request window.
4. **Previous-epoch peg-in completion** — peg-ins from the prior epoch's Treasury Movement complete as Bitcoin confirmations arrive (17–40 hours after epoch start).
5. **Peg deadline + Pegs Snapshot** — at the Cardano stability window (3k/f), all bridging requests are frozen for inclusion in the Treasury Movement.
6. **Update Y** — the current roster publishes the new roster's group public keys to `treasury.ak`.
7. **Build Treasury Movement Tx** — the current roster constructs the Bitcoin transaction that sweeps peg-in UTxOs, fulfils peg-out payments, and moves the treasury to the new Taproot address.
8. **Threshold signing cascade** — the current roster attempts 51% threshold signing. The federation path opens immediately once 51% setup/signing has finished unsuccessfully. The first mode to succeed wins.
9. **TM submission deadline** — the signed transaction must be posted to `treasury_movement.ak` before the epoch ends.
10. **New peg requests** — after the pegs snapshot, new requests accumulate for the next epoch's batch.

### Realistic epoch timeline (happy path)

![Realistic epoch lifecycle](images/epoch_lifecycle_realistic.png)

The epoch lifecycle above shows generous time windows for the signing cascade (51% → federation). In the happy path, when 51% quorum is available, the epoch proceeds much faster:

- **DKG**: ~5 minutes (off-chain, SPOs communicate via `bifrost_url` endpoints).
- **FROST 51% signing**: ~1 minute per Treasury Movement transaction.
- **Multiple TM batches**: the roster processes peg requests in multiple batches throughout the epoch, each cycling through build → sign → broadcast → Bitcoin confirmation.

The bottleneck is Bitcoin confirmation: each Treasury Movement requires ~100 Bitcoin blocks (~16.7 hours) for Binocular to promote the containing block to `confirmed` state. With a 5-day Cardano epoch, 4–5 TM batches fit sequentially, each handling its own set of peg-in sweeps and peg-out fulfillments. The final TM of the epoch moves the treasury to the new roster's Taproot address.

### Cardano stability window and peg finality

**Asymmetry between Bitcoin and Cardano finality.** Bitcoin PoW and Cardano Ouroboros Praos [6] both provide probabilistic finality, but Bifrost treats them asymmetrically. Binocular requires ~100 Bitcoin blocks (~17 h) before promoting a TM to `confirmed`, a depth at which Bitcoin reorgs are negligible for practical purposes. Cardano's common-prefix parameter $k = 2160$ is deliberately shallow (~12 h of expected block time) and reorgs shorter than $k$ are routine. The roster therefore has to be careful about what Cardano state it freezes into a Bitcoin-signed TM: a Cardano rollback *after* TM signing is a normal protocol event, whereas a Bitcoin reorg past Binocular confirmation is not.

**Why PegOuts need finality.** A PegOut lock is a Cardano-native action — fBTC is locked at `peg_out.ak` when the PegOut UTxO is created, and the TM pays treasury BTC to match. If the PegOut UTxO rolls back on Cardano *after* the TM is signed, the fBTC lock disappears from the canonical Cardano chain while the TM on Bitcoin still pays out. The withdrawer keeps their fBTC **and** collects BTC — a net loss to the treasury. Once signed and broadcast, a TM cannot un-pay a PegOut. Every PegOut must therefore be past any possible Cardano reorg before it enters the Pegs Snapshot.

**Why PegInRequests do not.** A PegInRequest is a Cardano-side *registration* of a Bitcoin deposit that already exists on Bitcoin and is already Binocular-confirmed. Three properties make its rollback recoverable:

- **Permissionless creation.** Anyone can create a PegInRequest with a valid Binocular inclusion proof; the proof's validity depends only on Bitcoin state.
- **BTC-side-bound mint authorization.** The depositor's fBTC-mint Schnorr signature is computed over `"BFR-mint-v1" ‖ btc_txid ‖ peg_in_utxo_id ‖ chosen_cardano_address`, so it is bound to the Bitcoin UTxO, not to the specific Cardano PegInRequest NFT. The same signature verifies against any re-created PegInRequest for the same deposit.
- **BTC-side-bound double-mint protection.** The completed-peg-ins MPT on `treasury.ak` is keyed by `peg_in_utxo_id`, not by the NFT.

If a PegInRequest rolls back after the TM is broadcast, the BTC sweep still succeeds on Bitcoin, and any watchtower (or the depositor) can re-create the PegInRequest; the depositor then claims fBTC with the original Schnorr signature. **Net impact: a delayed fBTC mint, never a fund loss.** Strict pre-snapshot finality is therefore *not required* for PegInRequests — only for PegOuts. In practice the protocol treats both uniformly at the same snapshot boundary for operational simplicity and for SPO determinism under restart/partition scenarios, not for fund-safety reasons.

**The Cardano stability window ($3k/f$).** Under Ouroboros Praos with honest-majority stake, any transaction buried under $k$ blocks is final with probability $1 - e^{-\Omega(k)}$ by the common-prefix property [6]. $k$ blocks arrive on average in $k/f$ slots, and the Chernoff analysis reaches overwhelming probability at $3k/f$ slots. On Cardano mainnet with $k = 2160$, $f = 0.05$ and one-second slots:

$$\tfrac{3k}{f} = \tfrac{3 \cdot 2160}{0.05} = 129{,}600 \text{ slots} = 36 \text{ hours.}$$

**Why $3k/f$ and not "just 2160 blocks".** Block-depth alone gives common-prefix finality only *relative to the chain an observer has already chosen*. An SPO or watchtower that restarts, loses peers, or is briefly partitioned must first re-select the canonical chain, and Cardano's Genesis rule [7] does so by comparing chain density inside a $3k/f$-slot window after the fork point — so $3k/f$ is a structural parameter of chain selection, not a safety margin bolted on top of $k$. It also provides ~3× wallclock headroom for peer-diversity and out-of-band cross-checks against eclipse scenarios, and aligns with the "settled state" notion used inside `cardano-node`.

**Consequence for the protocol.** The Pegs Snapshot is taken **$3k/f = 36$ hours after the epoch boundary** (phase 5 of the epoch lifecycle). PegOuts posted after the cut-off are deferred to the next epoch; the roster signs the BTC Treasury Movement only against this frozen, post-stability-window PegOut set, so that no Cardano rollback can retroactively invalidate a PegOut committed on Bitcoin. PegInRequests use the same boundary for determinism, even though their rollback is recoverable by re-creation.

## SPO Program

It's the program that Cardano SPOs must run and it allows signature aggregation. Being based on the FROST protocol requires:
1. registration of SPOs to participate in the protocol
2. formation of a roster of Cardano SPOs and distributed key generation (every epoch)
3. group signing.
We describe each in detail.

### SPO Bootstrap Flow

Before the first SPO registration, the protocol bootstrap creates the SPO-related on-chain state in production:

1. The treasury bootstrap policy mints the **Treasury state NFT** and creates the Treasury state UTxO at `treasury.ak`, with the initial treasury parameters and an empty `bifrost_identity_root`.
2. The `spos_registry.ak` minting policy has a one-shot bootstrap branch that consumes a fixed bootstrap nonce UTxO, mints the **registration-list root NFT** (`reg-root`), and creates the empty registration-list root UTxO at `spos_registry.ak`.
3. The `spo_bans.ak` policy has a one-shot bootstrap branch that consumes a fixed bootstrap nonce UTxO, mints the **ban-list root NFT** (`ban-root`), and creates the empty ban-list root UTxO at `spo_bans.ak`.

These three authenticated UTxOs are the starting point for all later SPO-related transactions. The runtime protocol never creates replacement roots. Instead:

- `register` consumes the current registration-list anchor element and the Treasury state UTxO, and produces the updated anchor element, the new registration node, and the updated Treasury state UTxO;
- `deregister` consumes the current registration node, its anchor element, and the Treasury state UTxO, and produces the updated anchor element and the updated Treasury state UTxO;
- `ban` inserts or updates a ban node: if the `pool_id` is not yet in the ban list, it consumes the current ban-list anchor element and produces the updated anchor element plus a new ban node; if the `pool_id` already has a ban node, it consumes that ban node and produces the updated ban node with the incremented `ban_counter`, extended `ban_until_time`, and recorded `evidence_hash`.

When the registration or ban list is otherwise empty, its bootstrap-created root UTxO is the anchor for the first insertion.

### SPO Registration

#### 1. Overview

Before participating in Bifrost, each SPO must complete a **one-time registration** that binds their Cardano pool identity to a long-term Bifrost identity key. This registration uses the SPO's cold key exactly once, after which all protocol operations use the Bifrost identity key. This design keeps cold keys offline except for initial registration and revocation.

Concretely, an SPO registers by submitting a Cardano `register_spo` transaction to `spos_registry.ak`. The transaction consumes the current registration-list anchor UTxO and the Treasury state UTxO, mints exactly one Bifrost Membership Token named by `pool_id`, and creates a registration-node UTxO whose value is that membership token plus min ADA and whose datum contains `bifrost_id_pk`, `bifrost_url`, and the ordered linked-list pointers. The redeemer carries `cold_vkey`, `cold_sig`, `bifrost_sig`, `registration_anchor_output_index`, and the non-membership witness proving that `bifrost_id_pk` is not already present in the Treasury state's `bifrost_identity_root`. The SPO program CLI is the intended operator interface for building this transaction; the protocol-level transaction shape is specified in Section 5 below.

#### 2. Keys

##### 2.1 SPO Identity (Cardano Layer)

- **`pool_id`**: unique stake pool identifier, derived as `pool_id = blake2b_224(cold_vkey)`.
- **`cold_vkey` / `cold_skey`**: long-term Ed25519 keypair. Used **only** for initial Bifrost registration and revocation. Must be kept on an air-gapped offline machine per Cardano security guidelines.

##### 2.2 Bifrost Identity

- **`bifrost_id_pk` / `bifrost_id_sk`**: long-term Secp256k1 identity keypair for Bifrost protocol operations.
- Self-generated by the SPO.
- Used for roster participation, DKG coordination, and encryption of DKG shares (via ECDH).

##### 2.3 Bifrost URL

- **`bifrost_url`**: endpoint URL where the SPO publishes DKG data and receives protocol messages.

#### 3. On-Chain Objects

##### 3.1 Bifrost Membership Token

- **Minting Policy**: `spos_registry.ak`
- **TokenName**: `pool_id`
- Exactly **one token per SPO** (enforced by minting policy).
- The token serves as the on-chain badge of Bifrost participation.
- The same minting policy also mints the registration-list root NFT during protocol bootstrap.

##### 3.2 Registration Linked-List

All registered SPOs are tracked using an **on-chain ordered linked-list**. Each node in the list represents a registered SPO and is stored as an individual UTxO at the registry script address. The list is ordered by `pool_id`, ensuring uniqueness and enabling efficient insertion and removal.

- **Node Value**: Bifrost Membership Token + the minimum ADA required to hold the token and datum.
- **Element key**: the ordering key is **not stored in the datum** — it is the **asset name of the registry-policy NFT** held in the UTxO. The list root carries the constant asset name `reg-root`; each registration node carries its `pool_id` (`blake2b_224(cold_vkey)`) as the asset name. The key is therefore minted under, and authenticated by, the `spos_registry.ak` policy: immutable across spends, unique, and indexable.
- **Element Datum** (`aiken_design_patterns/linked_list` `Element`):
```text
Element     = Constr(0, [ ElementData, Link ])
ElementData = Constr(0, [ Constr(0, []) ])                             -- Root  (ListRootData, empty)
            | Constr(1, [ Constr(0, [ bifrost_id_pk, bifrost_url ]) ]) -- Node  (RegistrationNodeData)
Link        = Constr(0, [ next_key ])  -- Some: asset name (pool_id) of the next node, ascending
            | Constr(1, [])            -- None: tail
```
where `RegistrationNodeData` is `{ bifrost_id_pk :: ByteArray, bifrost_url :: ByteArray }` — the Bifrost identity key and URL used later by the off-chain DKG and signing protocol.

The registration list is keyed by `pool_id`, not `bifrost_id_pk`: registration, revocation, and banning are all pool-scoped operations, so the compact cold-key-derived identifier `pool_id = blake2b_224(cold_vkey)` is the canonical on-chain key. It is carried as the **NFT asset name** (not a datum field), so it is authenticated by the minting policy and immutable across spends; the authorized `bifrost_id_pk` lives in the node datum because it is the key actually used later by the off-chain protocol.

The ADA locked in the registration node is only the minimum lovelace required by Cardano to hold the membership token and datum. It is not protocol collateral and is fully returned on voluntary revocation.

**Operations:**
- **Insert (ascending)**: A new node is inserted in ascending key order by verifying it sits between its neighbours — the spent **anchor** (the element with the greatest key strictly below the new node, or the root) keeps its data and is relinked to point at the new key, and the new node takes over the anchor's old link. Corresponds to `linked_list.insert_ascending` in the on-chain code.
- **Remove**: A node is removed by relinking its neighbours. Corresponds to `linked_list.remove` in the on-chain code.

**Spending Conditions**: Each registration node UTxO can be spent only by **voluntary revocation** via the cold-key-signed `bifrost-revoke` message, valid only at epoch boundary (enforced via Cardano validity intervals).

Fault-based banning does not spend the registration node. Instead, it updates the separate ban linked-list while the registration node remains in place.

The on-chain linked-list implementation uses the `aiken_design_patterns/linked_list` module [5].

##### 3.3 Bifrost Identity Root In Treasury State

Active Bifrost identity bindings are tracked in the Treasury state UTxO at `treasury.ak`. The Treasury state stores a Merkle Patricia Trie root over the map:

`bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id`

This root exists solely to enforce that no two active registrations can bind the same Bifrost identity key.

**Semantics:**
- At most one active mapping exists per `bifrost_id_pk`.
- Every active registration node must have a matching trie entry, and every trie entry must point to an active registration.
- Registration inserts a new `bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id` mapping.
- Revocation removes the existing mapping.
- Uniqueness is enforced by non-membership / membership proofs against the Treasury state's `bifrost_identity_root`.

This preserves `pool_id` as the canonical on-chain membership identity while ensuring that active `bifrost_id_pk` values remain globally unique.

##### 3.4 Ban Linked-List

Temporary and permanent bans are tracked in a **separate on-chain ordered linked-list** at `spo_bans.ak`. A ban entry does not replace or burn the Bifrost Membership Token; instead, off-chain roster derivation subtracts the active ban list from the registration list.

- **Node Value**: ban node auth token `ban/ || pool_id` + the minimum ADA required to hold the token and datum.
- **Element key**: as in the registration list (§3.2), the ordering key is **not stored in the datum** — it is the **asset name of the ban-policy NFT** held in the UTxO. The list root carries the asset name `ban-root`; each ban node carries `ban/ || pool_id`. Keys are authenticated by the `spo_bans.ak` policy.
- **Element Datum** (`aiken_design_patterns/linked_list` `Element`):
```text
Element     = Constr(0, [ ElementData, Link ])
ElementData = Constr(0, [ Constr(0, []) ])  -- Root (BanListRootData, empty)
            | Constr(1, [ Constr(0, [ ban_counter, ban_until_time, permanent, evidence_hashes ]) ])  -- Node (BanNodeData)
Link        = Constr(0, [ next_key ])  -- Some: asset name of the next node, ascending
            | Constr(1, [])            -- None: tail
```
where `BanNodeData` is `{ ban_counter :: Int, ban_until_time :: Int (POSIX ms), permanent :: Bool, evidence_hashes :: List<ByteArray> }`.

**Semantics:**
- At most one ban entry exists per `pool_id`.
- A ban is considered **active** at POSIX time `T` iff `permanent == True` or `ban_until_time > T`.
- Expired temporary ban entries may remain on-chain; off-chain roster derivation must ignore them once `permanent == False` and `ban_until_time <= T`.
- `ban_counter` is monotonically increasing for each `pool_id` and determines the exponential timeout duration.
- `evidence_hashes` records the already-punished fault evidence hashes for the pool. `spo_bans.ak` rejects repeated punishment for the same evidence hash.

#### 4. Registration Message and Signatures

Registration must prove both:
- the pool's cold key authorizes the binding; and
- the registrant actually controls `bifrost_id_sk`.

Both the cold key and the Bifrost identity key sign the same message:

```
"bifrost-spo" || pool_id || bifrost_id_pk || bifrost_url
```

Where:
- `"bifrost-spo"` is a 10-byte ASCII domain separator.
- `pool_id` is the 28-byte stake pool identifier derived from `cold_vkey`.
- `bifrost_id_pk` is the 33-byte compressed Secp256k1 public key.
- `bifrost_url` is the variable-length URL encoded as UTF-8 bytes.

The registration transaction therefore carries:
- `cold_sig`: Ed25519 signature by `cold_skey` over the message above.
- `bifrost_sig`: BIP340 Schnorr signature by `bifrost_id_sk` over the same message.

#### 5. Registration Transaction

A **registration tx** performs the following:

1. **Redeemer**: contains `cold_vkey`, `cold_sig`, `bifrost_sig`, `registration_anchor_output_index`, and the Merkle Patricia Trie witness needed to prove that `bifrost_id_pk` is currently absent from the Treasury state identity map.
2. **Inputs**:
   - Anchor element UTxO from the registration linked-list (either the root UTxO or an existing registration node, depending on where the new node is inserted).
   - Treasury state UTxO from `treasury.ak`, carrying the current `bifrost_identity_root`.
3. **Mint**: exactly one Bifrost Membership Token with `TokenName = pool_id` under `spos_registry.ak`.
4. **Outputs**:
   - New registration linked-list node UTxO at registry script address with:
     - Bifrost Membership Token + the minimum ADA required to hold the token and datum
     - Datum containing `bifrost_id_pk`, `bifrost_url`, and linked-list pointers (correctly ordered between neighbors)
   - Updated registration anchor node UTxO with its `next` pointer updated to reference the new registration node
   - Updated Treasury state UTxO whose `bifrost_identity_root` commits to the newly inserted mapping `bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id`

**Prototype transaction skeleton**:

```text

  datum:
  - same treasury fields
  - updated `bifrost_identity_root`

Required witnesses:
- `cold_sig`
- `bifrost_sig`

Required validity interval:
- epoch-boundary window
```

#### 6. On-Chain Verification

The minting policy verifies:

1. `pool_id == blake2b_224(cold_vkey)` — proves the cold key owns this pool.
2. `verifyEd25519Signature(cold_vkey, "bifrost-spo" || pool_id || bifrost_id_pk || bifrost_url, cold_sig)` — proves the cold key authorized this Bifrost identity binding.
3. `verifySchnorrSecp256k1Signature(bifrost_id_pk, SHA256("bifrost-spo" || pool_id || bifrost_id_pk || bifrost_url), bifrost_sig)` — proves the registrant actually controls `bifrost_id_sk`.
4. Exactly one token minted with `TokenName = pool_id`.
5. Registration output datum matches the signed message content.
6. **Registration linked-list ordering**: verifies the new registration node is correctly positioned between its neighbors, preventing duplicate `pool_id` registration.
7. **Registration linked-list state transition**: verifies the registration anchor node's `next` pointer is correctly updated to reference the new registration node.
8. **Bifrost identity non-membership**: verifies, against the Treasury state's `bifrost_identity_root`, that no active entry already exists for `bifrost_id_pk`.
9. **Bifrost identity root update**: verifies the updated Treasury state UTxO inserts the mapping `bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id` into the identity trie.

#### 7. Revocation

An SPO's membership can end through voluntary revocation or fault-based banning.

##### 7.1 Voluntary Revocation

The SPO's cold key signs an explicit revocation message:

```
"bifrost-revoke" || pool_id
```

Where:
- `"bifrost-revoke"` is a 14-byte ASCII domain separator.
- `pool_id` is the 28-byte pool identifier.

**Transaction**:
1. **Redeemer**: contains `cold_vkey`, `cold_sig`, `removed_node_input_index`, and `anchor_node_input_index`.
2. **Validity interval**: must fall within the epoch boundary window.
3. Spends the registration node and the Treasury state UTxO.
4. Burns the Bifrost Membership Token under `spos_registry.ak` and returns the registration node's ADA to an SPO-controlled output.
5. Removes the registration node from the registration linked-list by updating the anchor node's `next` pointer to skip the removed node.
6. Updates the Treasury state UTxO by removing the matching `bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id` mapping from the identity trie.

**Prototype transaction skeleton**:

```text
Transaction: deregister_spo

Inputs:
- registration node input at `spos_registry.ak`
- registration anchor input at `spos_registry.ak`
- treasury state input at `treasury.ak`

Reference Inputs:
- none

Withdrawals:
- none

Mint:
- none

Burn:
- under `spos_registry.ak`:
  - `pool_id` => -1

Outputs:
- continued registration anchor output at `spos_registry.ak`
- continued treasury state output at `treasury.ak`
  datum:
  - same treasury fields
  - updated `bifrost_identity_root`
- SPO-controlled output returning the deregistered node's ADA

Required witnesses:
- `cold_sig`

Required validity interval:
- epoch-boundary window
```

**On-chain verification**:
1. `pool_id == blake2b_224(cold_vkey)` — proves the cold key owns this pool.
2. `verifyEd25519Signature(cold_vkey, "bifrost-revoke" || pool_id, cold_sig)` — proves cold key authorized revocation.
3. **Validity interval**: transaction validity falls within the epoch boundary window.
4. Exactly one token burned with `TokenName = pool_id`.
5. **Registration linked-list removal**: verifies the anchor node's `next` pointer is correctly updated to skip the removed registration node, maintaining list ordering.
6. **Bifrost identity removal**: verifies, against the Treasury state's `bifrost_identity_root`, that the matching `bifrost_id_pk -> pool_id` mapping existed and is removed in the updated Treasury state UTxO.

After exit, the SPO may re-register with a new Bifrost identity.

##### 7.2 Banning

The protocol supports **temporary and permanent banning** of SPOs who misbehave during DKG or signing rounds. A banned SPO retains their Membership Token and stays in the registration linked-list, but is excluded from participating in roster formation through the separate ban linked-list.

**Exponential timeout**: Each temporary ban doubles the exclusion duration. If the new `ban_counter` is `n`, the new timeout duration is:

`base_ban_duration_ms * 2^(n - 1)`

The timeout is applied from the transaction validity interval's upper POSIX-time bound. For repeated temporary bans, the new expiry is:

`max(old_ban_until_time, ban_start_time) + duration`

When `ban_counter >= max_faults_before_permanent`, the ban node sets `permanent = True`. A permanent ban has no expiry.

**Active roster derivation**: At POSIX time `T`, the off-chain SPO program computes:

`eligible_roster(T) = registration_list(T) \ active_ban_list(T)`

where `active_ban_list(T)` contains all `pool_id`s whose ban entry satisfies `permanent == True || ban_until_time > T`.

**Fault verification is separated from banning**: fault verifier policies verify raw misbehavior evidence and mint singleton `FaultProof` tokens. The ban validator receives an allow-list containing three distinct policies: the DKG Round 1 fault policy, DKG Round 2 fault policy, and equivocation fault policy.

The consensus-critical token name is:

```
blake2b_256(pool_id || evidence_hash)
```

`evidence_hash` is the unique public input or evidence commitment for the fault. Datum attached to a fault UTxO may be used as metadata for off-chain indexing, but `spo_bans.ak` does not trust it for consensus. Instead, the ban redeemer carries `accused_pool_id` and `evidence_hash`; `spo_bans.ak` recomputes the token name and checks that exactly one authorized fault policy has minted and burned that token.

**Ban transaction format**: the ban transaction is permissionless and:
1. Spends a `FaultProof` token UTxO under one of the authorized fault policies.
2. Carries `accused_pool_id` and `evidence_hash` in the ban withdrawal redeemer.
3. References the accused SPO's registration node to bind the fault to an existing `pool_id`.
4. Spends the appropriate anchor element of the ban linked-list (the root UTxO for the first ban on a branch, otherwise an existing node), plus the existing ban node for this `pool_id` if one already exists.
5. Burns exactly the token `blake2b_256(accused_pool_id || evidence_hash)` under the same authorized fault policy found in the fault input.
6. Inserts or updates the ban node with the incremented `ban_counter`, updated `ban_until_time`, `permanent` flag, and new `evidence_hash`.
7. Rejects a repeated ban if `evidence_hash` is already present in the ban node's `evidence_hashes`.
8. Leaves the Membership Token and registration node untouched while recording the updated ban state in the ban linked-list.

  - `evidence_hashes = evidence_hash :: old_evidence_hashes`

Required witnesses:
- normal tx witnesses only

Required validity interval:
- finite POSIX-time interval with width at most `max_validity_window_ms`
```

**Ban expiry**: Once a temporary ban period elapses, the SPO automatically becomes eligible for roster participation again without needing to re-register. A permanent ban never expires.

#### 8. Security Properties

- **Cold key minimization**: The cold key is used only twice—once for registration, once for revocation (if needed). All other protocol operations use `bifrost_id_sk`.
- **Bifrost key proof-of-possession**: Registration proves that the registrant actually controls `bifrost_id_sk`, not just that the pool authorized the public key.
- **Air-gapped signing**: Both registration and revocation messages can be constructed offline and signed on an air-gapped machine.
- **Sybil resistance**: One membership token per `pool_id` enforced by minting policy.
- **Unique active Bifrost identities**: the Treasury state's `bifrost_identity_root` prevents two active registrations from sharing the same `bifrost_id_pk`.
- **Separated fault verification**: authorized fault verifier policies check raw evidence once and mint reusable `FaultProof` tokens; `spo_bans.ak` only applies ban updates.
- **No expiration**: Membership tokens remain valid indefinitely until explicitly revoked.



### Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

#### 1. Overview

The FROST Distributed Key Generation (DKG) process runs **entirely off-chain** using SPOs' `bifrost_url` endpoints. One DKG is run each epoch, producing the group public key $Y_{51}$ with a threshold ensuring any signing subset controls more than 51% of delegated stake. The DKG also produces individual signing shares $s_i$ for each participant. Upon successful completion, the **current roster** constructs and signs a Treasury Movement transaction that moves the treasury to the new Taproot address derived from $Y_{51}$ and $Y_{federation}$ (see **Taproot address construction**), and posts the signed transaction to Cardano at `treasury_movement.ak` for watchtowers to relay to the source blockchain. No DKG result is posted on Cardano.

**Prerequisite**: SPOs must complete SPO Registration (see previous section) before participating in DKG.

#### 2. Epoch Binding

Each DKG instance is bound to a Cardano epoch. The candidate set is determined by the on-chain registration and ban linked-lists at the end of the previous epoch, ensuring all SPOs have the same view of registered and temporarily excluded participants.

#### 3. Threshold Calculation

The threshold `t` is computed to guarantee that **any** subset of `t` signers controls stake above the security threshold. Since the worst case is the `t` SPOs with the smallest stakes, we define:

```
t = min { k : combined_stake(bottom k SPOs by stake) > security_threshold }
```

Where:
- `security_threshold` is a protocol parameter (e.g., 51% of total delegated stake among Bifrost SPOs).
- SPOs are ranked by their delegated stake at the epoch boundary.
- `t` is the minimum number of SPOs such that even the weakest `t` SPOs exceed the threshold.

This ensures that **any** subset of `t` signers collectively controls sufficient stake to authorize bridge operations, regardless of which specific SPOs participate in a signing session.

For a fixed `(epoch, threshold-mode)` DKG instance, the resulting threshold `t` is **frozen for all attempts**. Retries may exclude or ban participants, but they do not recompute `t`; the instance simply fails once fewer than `t` eligible participants remain.

#### 4. Candidate Set and Ordering

##### 4.1 Candidate Enumeration

All SPOs with valid Bifrost Membership Tokens that are present in the registration linked-list and not present in the active ban linked-list are candidates for the DKG.

##### 4.2 Canonical Ordering

Candidates are ordered **lexicographically by `bifrost_id_pk`** (32-byte comparison). Each participant is assigned an index $i = 1..n$ based on their position in this ordering.

This is separate from the on-chain registration linked-list ordering. The linked-list is keyed by `pool_id` because membership and bans are pool-scoped; once the active registrations are read from Cardano, the off-chain SPO protocol re-sorts them by the bound `bifrost_id_pk` values to obtain the canonical FROST participant ordering.

##### 4.3 Candidate Information

For each candidate $P_i$, the following information is retrieved:
- `pool_id` — from Membership UTxO.
- `bifrost_id_pk` — from Membership UTxO datum.
- `bifrost_url` — from Membership UTxO datum.
- `delegated_stake` — queried from Cardano ledger state.
- `ban_until_time` and `permanent` — from the ban linked-list, if a matching ban entry exists.

#### 5. Round 0: Initialization

Each SPO $P_i$ performs the following initialization steps:

1. Determine the current epoch.
2. Retrieve the registration and ban linked-list states from the end of the previous epoch.
3. Enumerate all registered SPOs from the registration list and subtract the active ban list.
4. Query delegated stake for each candidate.
5. Compute threshold $t$ as described in Section 3.
6. Order candidates lexicographically by `bifrost_id_pk` and assign indices.
7. Verify own participation (own `pool_id` is in the candidate set).

Ordinary non-participation does not create a new DKG attempt. All honest parties stay in the same `(epoch, threshold, attempt)` namespace and deterministically shrink the qualified subset as the Round 1 and Round 2 deadlines expire. The `attempt` field is therefore reserved for exceptional full reruns after direct cryptographic faults or epoch-level resets; in the normal protocol flow it remains `0`.

#### 6. Round 1: Commitments and Proofs of Knowledge

Each SPO $P_i$ performs the following steps per FROST specification [2]:

1. Construct a random polynomial $f_i(x)$ of degree $t-1$ over the Secp256k1 scalar field.
2. Compute proof of knowledge $σ_i$ of the degree-zero coefficient $a_{i0}$.
3. Compute public commitment $C_i = [φ_{i0}, ..., φ_{i(t-1)}]$ where $φ_{ij} = a_{ij} · G$.

##### 6.1 Round 1 Payload

Each $P_i$ publishes their Round 1 data at:

```
<bifrost_url>/dkg/<epoch>/<threshold>/<attempt>/round1/<pool_id>.json
```

Where `<threshold>` is `51` (one DKG per epoch), and `<attempt>` is the DKG namespace field in the current epoch. In the normal protocol flow it remains `0`.

**Payload structure**:

```json
{
  "commitment": ["<hex, 33 bytes>", ...],
  "sigma_i": "<hex, 64 bytes>",
  "signature": "<hex, 64 bytes>"
}
```

Where:
- `commitment` is an array of $t$ compressed Secp256k1 points (33 bytes each).
- `sigma_i` is the Schnorr proof of knowledge (challenge || response, 64 bytes).
- `signature` is a BIP340 Schnorr signature over `SHA256(canonical_bytes)` using `bifrost_id_sk`.

**Canonical byte layout** (for authentication and on-chain misbehavior proofs):

```
"bifrost-dkg-r1" || epoch (8B BE) || threshold (8B BE, 51) || attempt (8B BE) || pool_id (28B)
  || φ_{i0} (33B) || ... || φ_{i(t-1)} (33B) || σ_i (64B)
```

JSON is for transport; the signature covers `SHA256(canonical_bytes)`.

##### 6.2 Round 1 Verification

Each $P_i$ fetches every Round 1 payload that was published before the common Round 1 deadline and verifies that $σ_i$ is a valid proof of knowledge for $φ_{l0}$.

If an SPO does not publish Round 1 before the deadline, it simply does not enter the attempt's provisional subset and is not punished for that fact alone.

If a published Round 1 payload is invalid, or if two distinct signed Round 1 payloads for the same sender and namespace are observed, the process proceeds to **Misbehavior Handling** (Section 9).

#### 7. Round 2: Secret Share Distribution

Each SPO $P_i$ computes and distributes secret shares to all other participants.

##### 7.1 Share Computation

For each participant $P_l$ (where $l ≠ i$), compute the secret share $(l, f_i(l))$.

##### 7.2 Share Encryption

For each recipient $P_l$:

1. Generate ephemeral Secp256k1 keypair $(e_i, E_i)$.
2. Compute shared secret: `ss = ECDH(e_i, bifrost_id_pk_l)`.
3. Derive symmetric key: `k = HKDF(ss, info = "bifrost-dkg-share")`.
4. Encrypt share: `ciphertext = f_i(l) XOR k` (32 bytes).

The share is a 32-byte Secp256k1 scalar, encrypted with the derived key.

##### 7.3 Round 2 Payload

Each $P_i$ publishes their Round 2 data at:

```
<bifrost_url>/dkg/<epoch>/<threshold>/<attempt>/round2/<pool_id>.json
```

Where `<threshold>` is `51` (one DKG per epoch), and `<attempt>` is the same namespace field as in Round 1.

**Payload structure**:

```json
{
  "shares": [
    {
      "recipient_pool_id": "<hex, 28 bytes>",
      "ephemeral_pk": "<hex, 33 bytes>",
      "ciphertext": "<hex, 32 bytes>"
    }
  ],
  "signature": "<hex, 64 bytes>"
}
```

Where:
- `recipient_pool_id` identifies the intended recipient.
- `ephemeral_pk` is the compressed Secp256k1 ephemeral public key $E_i$.
- `ciphertext` is the XOR-encrypted share.
- The `shares` array contains one entry per other participant in the current attempt's provisional Round 1 subset.
- `signature` is a BIP340 Schnorr signature over `SHA256(canonical_bytes)` using `bifrost_id_sk`.

**Canonical byte layout** (for authentication and on-chain misbehavior proofs):

```
"bifrost-dkg-r2" || epoch (8B BE) || threshold (8B BE, 51) || attempt (8B BE) || pool_id (28B)
  || [recipient_pool_id (28B) || ephemeral_pk (33B) || ciphertext (32B)] × m
```

Shares are ordered by `recipient_pool_id` (lexicographic) for determinism. Here `m` is the number of other participants in the current attempt's provisional Round 1 subset. JSON is for transport; the signature covers `SHA256(canonical_bytes)`. Because the full encrypted-share vector is published as one public payload, publishing Round 2 at all makes the sender's whole Round 2 state retrievable by every SPO.

##### 7.4 Round 2 Decryption and Verification

Each recipient $P_l$:

1. Fetch Round 2 payload from each sender $P_i$.
2. Find the entry where `recipient_pool_id == pool_id_l`.
3. Compute shared secret: `ss = ECDH(bifrost_id_sk_l, ephemeral_pk)`.
4. Derive key `k = HKDF(ss, info = "bifrost-dkg-share")` and decrypt: `f_i(l) = ciphertext XOR k`.
5. Verify the share against sender's Round 1 commitment:

   $f_i(l) · G = \sum_{j=0}^{t-1} (l^j · φ_{ij})$

If a sender that was present in the provisional Round 1 subset fails to publish any Round 2 payload by the Round 2 deadline, that sender is removed from the final qualified subset. Honest parties ignore that sender's commitments and shares in the final share sum and public key derivation.

If verification fails for any share from $P_i$, or if two distinct signed Round 2 payloads for the same sender and namespace are observed, the process proceeds to **Misbehavior Handling** (Section 9).

#### 8. Finalization

Upon successful verification of all shares from the final qualified subset $Q$, each $P_i$:

1. Computes their long-lived private signing share by summing the shares received from every sender in the final qualified subset: $s_i = \sum_{l \in Q} f_l(i)$

2. Computes their public verification share: $Y_i = s_i · G$

3. Computes the group public key from the same qualified subset: $Y = \sum_{l \in Q} φ_{l0}$

All participants arrive at the same group public key $Y$. Ordinary non-participation therefore shrinks $Q$ in-place rather than forcing a DKG restart.

The above steps are run once per epoch with threshold $t_{51}$, producing $Y_{51}$.

4. Derives the Bitcoin Treasury Taproot address from $Y_{51}$ together with $Y_{federation}$ (see **Taproot address construction**).

5. The **current roster** publishes the successfully derived group public key on Cardano at `treasury.ak`, authenticated by a FROST group signature from the current roster. If the DKG did not complete, the SPO threshold mode is unavailable for the epoch and the federation path remains as the emergency fallback. This makes the new Treasury address publicly verifiable on-chain, allowing depositors to look up the correct Treasury key and derive the Treasury and peg-in Taproot addresses.

#### 9. Misbehavior Handling

Fault handling is split by round and evidence type:

- **Round 1 non-publication** is not punishable; the SPO simply does not join that attempt's provisional subset.
- **Round 2 non-publication** is not punishable; the SPO is dropped from the final qualified subset.
- **Round 1 invalidity** and **Round 1 equivocation** are directly punishable.
- **Round 2 invalidity** and **Round 2 equivocation** are directly punishable.

##### 9.1 Fault Verifier Policies And `FaultProof` Tokens

Misbehavior verification is separated from ban-list updates. Production uses separate authorized verifier policies for DKG Round 1 faults, DKG Round 2 faults, and equivocation faults. When a fault is established, the corresponding policy mints exactly one singleton `FaultProof` token and may create a verifier UTxO carrying metadata:

```json
{ kind               :: InvalidPayload | Equivocation
, accused_pool_id    :: ByteArray
, namespace_hash     :: ByteArray
, evidence_hash      :: ByteArray
}
```

The `FaultProof` token name is:

```
blake2b_256(pool_id || evidence_hash)
```

`namespace_hash = blake2b_256(phase || epoch || threshold_or_mode || attempt || txid?)`, where `txid` is omitted for DKG namespaces. `spo_bans.ak` does not trust the metadata datum; it authenticates the fault by checking the token name and the fault verifier policy id against its allow-list.

**Prototype transaction skeleton**:

```text
Transaction: publish_fault_proof

Inputs:
- one arbitrary claimant-controlled nonce input

Reference Inputs:
- none

Withdrawals:
- none

Mint:
- under the matching fault verifier policy:
  - `blake2b_256(pool_id || evidence_hash)` => +1

Burn:
- none

Outputs:
- claimant-controlled output containing:
  - fault-proof token
  - min ADA
  datum:
  - `kind`
  - `accused_pool_id`
  - `namespace_hash`
  - `evidence_hash`

Required witnesses:
- normal tx witnesses only

Required validity interval:
- none
```

##### 9.2 Direct fault proofs

Direct proofs are permissionless and do not require roster consensus.

**Invalid payload proofs** use Halo2 ZK proofs. The sign-the-hash scheme (see **Authentication**) enables this: the accused SPO's signed `message_hash` binds them to specific protocol data, and a ZK circuit proves that data is cryptographically invalid without revealing the full payload on-chain.

**Invalid payload types and what the ZK circuit proves:**

- **DKG Round 1 — invalid proof of knowledge**: the circuit verifies that $σ_i$ is not a valid Schnorr proof for $φ_{i0}$.
- **DKG Round 2 — share inconsistent with commitment**: the circuit verifies that $f_i(l) · G ≠ \sum l^j · φ_{ij}$, i.e., the decrypted share does not match the Round 1 commitment polynomial.
- **FROST signing — invalid partial signature**: the circuit verifies that $z_i$ is inconsistent with the nonce commitment and group parameters.

**Invalid payload proof structure:**

1. The prover submits `message_hash` (32B) + accused SPO signature (64B) + Halo2 proof + public inputs.
2. The appropriate fault verifier policy verifies the signature via `verifySchnorrSecp256k1Signature(bifrost_id_pk, message_hash, signature)`.
3. The verifier policy verifies the Halo2 proof.
4. The ZK circuit proves that the signed payload hashing to `message_hash` contains the specific invalidity.
5. On success, the verifier policy mints a `FaultProof` token for `kind = InvalidPayload`.

**Size**: the on-chain transaction carries the message hash, signature, Halo2 proof, and public inputs. The verifier cost depends on the configured proof system and generated verifier.

**Equivocation proofs** are direct and do not use ZK. The prover submits two distinct signed payloads from the same accused SPO for the same namespace. The equivocation verifier policy verifies:

1. both payloads belong to the same `namespace_hash`;
2. both signatures verify under the accused SPO's `bifrost_id_pk`; and
3. the two canonical payload hashes are different.

On success, the equivocation verifier policy mints a `FaultProof` token for `kind = Equivocation`.

##### 9.3 Exclusion Of Non-Participants

Ordinary non-participation is handled by deterministic exclusion, not by any separate publication-challenge mechanism.

For DKG:

1. The Round 1 deadline fixes the provisional subset `L1` of participants that published valid Round 1 payloads.
2. The Round 2 deadline fixes the final qualified subset `Q` of participants in `L1` that also published complete Round 2 payloads.
3. Honest parties compute their long-lived shares and the group public key using `Q` only.
4. If `Q` contains fewer than `t` participants, or if its total delegated stake is below the target threshold for that DKG, that threshold-mode DKG is simply unavailable for the epoch.

For signing:

1. The Round 1 deadline fixes the provisional signing subset `S1`.
2. The Round 2 deadline fixes the final signing subset `S2` of members of `S1` that published valid partial signatures.
3. Aggregation uses `S2` only.
4. If `S2` does not meet the active threshold, the current signing mode fails immediately and the next lower mode may start.

This is the ordinary non-participation path. Only cryptographically invalid or equivocated payloads go through the direct-fault ban flow.

##### 9.4 Direct Fault Consequences

Direct cryptographic faults remain punishable:

1. An invalid or equivocated Round 1/2 payload is proven at the appropriate authorized fault verifier policy.
2. The verifier policy mints a `FaultProof` token named `blake2b_256(pool_id || evidence_hash)`.
3. `spo_bans.ak` may then ban the accused SPO via the time-based ban list.

Non-participation alone does not mint a `FaultProof` token and does not create a separate restart loop.

#### 10. Treasury Handoff

Upon successful DKG completion and publication of the new Treasury public key $Y_{51}$ to `treasury.ak`:

1. The **new roster** derives the Bitcoin Treasury Taproot address from $Y_{51}$ and $Y_{federation}$ (see **Taproot address construction**).
2. The **current roster** reads all confirmed PegInRequest UTxOs and pending PegOut UTxOs from Cardano.
3. The **current roster** attempts to construct and sign a full Treasury Movement transaction (peg-ins + peg-outs + treasury move to new address) using the cascade signing process (see **Spending paths and Treasury Movement variants**):
   - First, attempt to collect 51% partial signatures ($Y_{51}$) — main line, cheapest (key path on all inputs).
   - If the 51% mode does not yield a usable signature within its bounded setup and signing phases, the federation signs using $Y_{federation}$ (script path with timelock).
   - If the resulting transaction would be too large, it is split into multiple transactions.
4. The signed transaction is posted to Cardano at `treasury_movement.ak`.
5. Watchtowers pick up the signed transaction from Cardano and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network.

Once the Treasury Movement transaction is confirmed on Bitcoin, the epoch transition is complete. The new roster now controls the treasury. Anyone can then complete pending peg-outs on Cardano using Binocular inclusion proofs. Pending peg-ins can also be completed — both signing modes sweep peg-in UTxOs.

#### 11. Security Properties

- **Off-chain execution**: No DKG data is posted on Cardano; only the signed Treasury Movement transaction (posted to `treasury_movement.ak`) and the resulting source blockchain transaction are publicly visible.
- **Threshold security**: Any $t$ signers control stake above the security threshold.
- **Misbehavior accountability**: Fraudulent SPOs can be identified and excluded.
- **Objective exclusions**: bans are applied only by consuming verified `FaultProof` token records, so exclusions are driven by objective evidence rather than discretionary roster approval.
- **Replay resistance**: Each DKG is bound to a unique epoch number.
- **Single curve**: Using Secp256k1 throughout eliminates curve conversion complexity.

### Group signing

In what follows we summarize the *preprocess* and signing stages according to the FROST documentation [2], closely following their notation, and emphasizing special considerations relevant to SPO-based FROST groups.

#### Per-input signing

A Treasury Movement transaction has multiple inputs — one treasury UTxO plus $k$ peg-in UTxOs — and **each input requires a separate FROST signing round**. This is because:

- **Different sighash per input**: BIP341 sighash commits to the input index, so each input has a distinct 32-byte message to sign.
- **Different tweaked key per input**: each input has a different Taproot tree (the treasury tree differs from peg-in trees, and each peg-in tree differs because `depositor_pubkey_hash` varies), producing a different tweak and therefore a different effective signing key.

With `SIGHASH_ALL` (default for Taproot), each signature commits to all inputs and all outputs, but a per-input signature is still required. For a TM transaction with $k+1$ inputs, SPOs run $k+1$ parallel FROST signing rounds.

All SPOs agree on input ordering deterministically (treasury input first, then peg-in inputs ordered by txid+vout lexicographically), so nonce commitments and partial signatures are published as arrays indexed by input position.

#### Deterministic TM construction

All SPOs independently construct the same Treasury Movement (TM) transaction from shared state, with no coordinator. If any field differs between SPOs, signing will fail (different `txid` → mismatched nonce commitments). The rules below fully determine every byte of the unsigned transaction.

**Shared state reference.** Every SPO reads the same Cardano confirmed state:

- Confirmed **PegInRequest** UTxOs — each contains the raw Bitcoin peg-in transaction from which the SPO extracts the Bitcoin txid+vout being swept.
- Pending **PegOut** UTxOs — each specifies a destination Bitcoin address (as `scriptPubKey` bytes) and an amount.
- The current **treasury Bitcoin UTxO** (txid+vout), known from the previous TM's change output or from protocol bootstrap.

**Transaction version and locktime.**

- Version: **2** (required for `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` in Taproot scripts).
- Locktime: **0**.

**Inputs (deterministic ordering).**

- Input 0: the current treasury UTxO (txid+vout from shared state).
- Inputs 1..$k$: peg-in UTxOs, ordered lexicographically by (txid ‖ vout). Comparison is byte-by-byte, left-to-right; txid is 32 bytes, vout is encoded as 4 bytes little-endian.
- Sequence numbers (per spending mode):
  - **51% mode**: `0xFFFFFFFD` for every input. Bit 31 is set, so BIP68 relative timelocks are disabled; the value is below `0xFFFFFFFE`, so RBF is signaled. No CSV is evaluated in this path.
  - **Federation mode**: `timeout_federation` (the protocol parameter, encoded as a BIP68 block-based value with bit 31 clear) for every input. Bit 31 clear enables BIP68, satisfying `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY <timeout_federation>` in the federation script leaves. Any value with bit 31 clear is automatically below `0xFFFFFFFE`, so RBF is also signaled.

**Outputs (deterministic ordering).**

- Output 0: treasury change — remaining balance sent to the Treasury Taproot address.
  - For intermediate TMs within the epoch: the current roster's Treasury address.
  - For the **final TM of the epoch**: the new roster's Treasury address (derived from the new DKG group key).
- Outputs 1..$m$: peg-out payments, ordered lexicographically by raw `scriptPubKey` bytes. Each output pays the requested amount minus the protocol fee (see below).

**Amounts and fees.**

- Fee rate: `fee_rate_sat_per_vb` is a protocol parameter stored in the Config UTxO on Cardano, updated by governance.
- Bitcoin miner fee: `fee = tx_vsize × fee_rate_sat_per_vb` (integer division, rounded up). The transaction vsize is deterministic since all SPOs build the same transaction.
- Per-peg-out protocol fee: a fixed fee (protocol parameter) deducted from each peg-out output, covering the miner fee share and protocol operating costs.
- Each peg-out output: amount from the PegOut UTxO datum minus the per-peg-out protocol fee.
- Treasury change: sum of all input values − sum of peg-out output values − Bitcoin miner fee.

**Witness (empty at construction time).**

The transaction is constructed unsigned — every input carries an empty witness. The `txid` is computed from the non-witness serialization (per BIP141). Witnesses are populated after FROST signing completes.

**Multiple TMs per epoch.**

The roster may process **multiple TM transactions** within an epoch, each cycling through build → sign → broadcast → Bitcoin confirmation (see **Realistic epoch timeline**). Peg-ins and peg-outs are processed FIFO — each TM includes the oldest pending requests first, so earlier depositors and withdrawers are served before later ones. Each TM's treasury input is the previous TM's treasury change output. The final TM of the epoch sends the treasury change to the new roster's Taproot address.

The signing namespace is identified by the tuple `(epoch, txid, mode, attempt)` where:
- `mode ∈ {67, 51}` selects the active SPO threshold path;
- `attempt` is reserved for exceptional reruns of the same mode for the same TM; in the normal protocol flow it remains `0`; and
- every namespace requires **fresh nonce commitments**. A signer must never reuse FROST nonces across different `(epoch, txid, mode, attempt)` tuples, even if the unsigned Bitcoin transaction is unchanged.

Each SPO publishes its constructed TM at:

```
<bifrost_url>/sign/<epoch>/tm.json
```

```json
{
  "raw_tx": "<hex>",
  "txid": "<hex, 32 bytes>"
}
```

The `txid` (Bitcoin transaction hash, computed from the unsigned transaction's non-witness data) uniquely identifies the TM being signed and is used as the key in FROST signing URLs. Other SPOs fetch this endpoint to verify they agree on the transaction before signing.

#### Preprocess

Each SPO $P_i$ in the roster performs this stage prior to signing.
1. For each input $j = 0..k$, samples random single-use nonces $(d_{ij}, e_{ij})$.
2. Derives commitment shares $(D_{ij}, E_{ij})$ for each input.
3. Stores $((d_{ij}, D_{ij}), (e_{ij}, E_{ij}))$ for later use in signing operations.
4. Publishes nonce commitments at `<bifrost_url>/sign/<epoch>/<txid>/<mode>/<attempt>/round1/<pool_id>.json`.

**Payload structure**:

```json
{
  "nonce_commitments": [
    { "D": "<hex, 33 bytes>", "E": "<hex, 33 bytes>" }
  ],
  "signature": "<hex, 64 bytes>"
}
```

Where:
- `nonce_commitments` is an array of $(D_{ij}, E_{ij})$ pairs (compressed Secp256k1 points), one per input, ordered by input index.
- `signature` is a BIP340 Schnorr signature over `SHA256(canonical_bytes)` using `bifrost_id_sk`.

**Canonical byte layout**:

```
"bifrost-sign-r1" || epoch (8B BE) || txid (32B) || mode (8B BE, 67 or 51) || attempt (8B BE) || pool_id (28B)
  || D_{i,0} (33B) || E_{i,0} (33B) || D_{i,1} (33B) || E_{i,1} (33B) || ...
```

Nonce pairs are concatenated in input-index order. JSON is for transport; the signature covers `SHA256(canonical_bytes)`.

### Signing mechanism

Each SPO $P_i$ in the subset participating in signing performs these steps **for each input** $j = 0..k$:
1. Fetches nonce commitments from peers' HTTP endpoints (`<bifrost_url>/sign/<epoch>/<txid>/<mode>/<attempt>/round1/<pool_id>.json`) to assemble the list $B_j$ of triads $(i, D_{i,j}, E_{i,j})$ corresponding to SPOs in the subset.
2. Computes the BIP341 sighash $m_j$ for input $j$ (which commits to all inputs and outputs via `SIGHASH_ALL`, but is unique per input due to the input index).
3. Computes the set of binding values, the group commitment $R_j$ and the challenge for input $j$.
4. Computes their response (signing share) $z_{i,j}$ using their long-lived secret share $s_i$ and the per-input tweaked key.

After computing all $z_{i,j}$:
5. Each $P_i$ publishes their partial signatures at `<bifrost_url>/sign/<epoch>/<txid>/<mode>/<attempt>/round2/<pool_id>.json`.
6. Each $P_i$ fetches partial signatures from peers and classifies any observed fault:
   - missing Round 2 payload from a member of the provisional subset -> exclude that signer from the final signing subset;
   - two different signed Round 2 payloads for the same peer and namespace -> submit an equivocation proof;
   - cryptographically invalid partial signature -> submit an invalid-payload proof.
7. If the remaining valid partial signatures still satisfy the active threshold, continue.
8. Each $P_i$ can compute the group's response for each input (the sum of $z_{i,j}$'s), arriving to the same per-input signature $σ_j = (R_j, z_j)$, completing the fully signed transaction.

**Round 2 payload structure**:

```json
{
  "partial_signatures": [
    { "sighash": "<hex, 32 bytes>", "z_i": "<hex, 32 bytes>" }
  ],
  "signature": "<hex, 64 bytes>"
}
```

Where:
- `partial_signatures` is an array ordered by input index, one entry per TM transaction input.
- `sighash` is the BIP341 sighash for this input.
- `z_i` is the partial signature for this input (32-byte scalar).
- `signature` is a BIP340 Schnorr signature over `SHA256(canonical_bytes)` using `bifrost_id_sk`.

**Canonical byte layout**:

```
"bifrost-sign-r2" || epoch (8B BE) || txid (32B) || mode (8B BE, 67 or 51) || attempt (8B BE) || pool_id (28B)
  || [sighash_j (32B) || z_{i,j} (32B)] × (k+1)
```

Entries are concatenated in input-index order. JSON is for transport; the signature covers `SHA256(canonical_bytes)`.

### Threshold failover

There is no separate timeout for the transitions `67 -> 51 -> federation`. Instead, each DKG and signing round has its own bounded submission deadline, and a lower-threshold mode becomes eligible immediately once the higher mode's bounded setup/signing phases finish unsuccessfully.

For a given TM and mode (`67` or `51`), all honest SPOs derive the same signing state:

1. Start from the **current roster** stored on-chain for the active treasury.
2. Remove any SPOs with an active on-chain ban entry.
3. Wait until the Round 1 deadline and collect every valid Round 1 payload published in the current `(epoch, txid, mode, attempt)` namespace.
4. Define the provisional signing subset `S1` as the SPOs that published valid Round 1 payloads before the deadline.
5. If the delegated stake of `S1` is below the active mode threshold, the mode fails immediately when Round 1 closes.
6. Otherwise continue with exactly `S1` into Round 2.
7. Wait until the Round 2 deadline and collect every valid Round 2 payload published by members of `S1`.
8. Define the final signing subset `S2` as the members of `S1` that published valid Round 2 payloads before the deadline.
9. Invalid or equivocating Round 2 payloads may be proven at the appropriate authorized fault verifier policy and are excluded from aggregation.
10. If `S2` provides enough valid partial signatures to satisfy the active threshold, the mode succeeds.
11. Otherwise the mode fails immediately when Round 2 closes.

**Mode transition rules:**
- **51% mode** opens first and uses the $Y_{51}$ treasury key path if the DKG completed during setup.
- **Federation mode** opens immediately once 51% mode has finished unsuccessfully, or immediately if the DKG did not produce a usable key during setup.
- The overall bound for the cascade is therefore implicit: it is the sum of the bounded DKG and signing step deadlines, with no extra inter-mode timer.

Federation mode does not use the SPO HTTP endpoints. It is an on-chain and Bitcoin-level emergency fallback after the 51% mode has either failed or never become available.

### Cardano submission and leader reward

After FROST signing completes, a single SPO must submit the result on Cardano — posting the signed TM to `treasury_movement.ak` and updating keys in the Treasury UTxO after DKG. The submitting SPO (the **leader**) is rewarded for this service. A deterministic leader election with timeout cascade ensures fairness, unpredictability, and liveness.

**Leader selection.** The roster is sorted by `pool_id` (lexicographic). The primary leader is selected using the previous TM's Bitcoin txid as entropy (unpredictable before the previous TM is mined, available to all SPOs and verifiable on-chain via the Treasury Info reference input):

`leader_index = hash("bifrost-leader" || prev_tm_txid || tm_sequence) mod roster_size`

where `prev_tm_txid` is read from the Treasury Info UTxO and `tm_sequence` is the sequence number of the current TM within the epoch (0-indexed). For key publication after DKG, `tm_sequence` is replaced by the literal `"dkg"`.

**Timeout cascade.** If the primary leader does not submit within $T$ slots (protocol parameter, e.g. 60 slots ≈ 1 minute), the next SPO in roster order becomes eligible. After another $T$ slots the next one, and so on (wrapping around). Concretely, SPO at roster index $i$ becomes eligible at slot:

`eligible_slot[i] = signing_complete_slot + ((i - leader_index) mod roster_size) × T`

where `signing_complete_slot` is the slot at which FROST signing finished (deterministic: the slot when the last required round-2 payload became available). Each SPO monitors the chain — if a predecessor has already submitted, it does nothing.

**On-chain verification.** The `treasury_movement.ak` validator enforces leader legitimacy:

1. Reads `prev_tm_txid` from the Treasury Info reference input.
2. Computes `leader_index` using the formula above.
3. Looks up the expected `pool_id` in the roster (via the on-chain linked-list).
4. Verifies the submitter's `pool_id` matches, or — if the transaction validity interval start exceeds the leader's eligibility window — allows the next eligible SPO per the timeout cascade.
5. Records the leader's `pool_id` in the `treasury_movement.ak` output datum.

**Leader reward.** When a depositor mints fBTC (spending a PegInRequest UTxO and referencing the `treasury_movement.ak` UTxO), the `bridged_asset.ak` minting policy enforces that one output pays a reward (protocol parameter) to the leader identified in the `treasury_movement.ak` datum. This distributes the cost of Cardano transaction fees across all minting transactions that benefit from the TM, and incentivizes timely submission.

**Example.** A roster of 5 SPOs (sorted by pool_id: $A, B, C, D, E$). The previous TM's Bitcoin txid hashes to leader index 3, so $D$ is the primary submitter. With $T = 60$ slots and signing completing at slot 1000:

- Slot 1000: $D$ submits, posts TM to `treasury_movement.ak` with `leader = D`.
- Slot 1060: if $D$ hasn't submitted, $E$ becomes eligible.
- Slot 1120: $A$, then slot 1180: $B$, then slot 1240: $C$.

Later, when depositors mint fBTC referencing this TM, each minting transaction includes an output paying the reward to $D$.

**Applies to both:**
- **TM submission**: posting the signed Bitcoin transaction to `treasury_movement.ak`.
- **Key publication**: posting the new DKG group key $Y_{51}$ to `treasury.ak` after DKG completes.

## SPOs communication

SPO programs communicate peer-to-peer over HTTP. Each SPO runs a lightweight HTTP server at the `bifrost_url` registered in the on-chain linked-list. Since every SPO's URL is publicly readable on Cardano, no separate discovery mechanism is needed — each SPO enumerates the registry to obtain the full set of peer endpoints.

### On-chain state used by the SPO program

Every honest SPO derives its local protocol state from Cardano first, then uses HTTP only to exchange the off-chain payloads for the current attempt. The required on-chain reads are:

* the **registration linked-list**, to determine all registered Bifrost SPOs;
* the **ban linked-list**, to determine which `pool_id`s are temporarily or permanently excluded;
* the **active `FaultProof` UTxOs**, to observe already-minted direct-fault token records;
* the **Treasury state** in `treasury.ak`, to learn the current treasury keys, the current roster authority, and the latest accepted handoff state;
* the **pending PegInRequest and PegOut UTxOs**, to deterministically build the next Treasury Movement transaction; and
* the **latest `treasury_movement.ak` outputs**, to determine whether a TM has already been posted by another eligible leader.

The SPO program must classify peers as:

* **registered**: present in the registration linked-list;
* **banned**: present in the registration linked-list and with an active temporary or permanent ban entry;
* **eligible**: registered and not currently banned; and
* **current roster member**: part of the on-chain roster that currently controls the treasury for signing and treasury handoff.

### Pull model

Communication follows a **replicated pull model**: each namespace defines one public payload per sender at a well-known URL path, and every SPO polls every other SPO's endpoint to fetch the same bytes. There is no coordinator, no push notifications, and no peer-specific delivery path. In particular, DKG Round 2 publishes the full encrypted-share vector as one public blob, so if a sender publishes Round 2 at all, any SPO can retrieve the same payload.

URL path conventions (`<threshold>` is `67` or `51` — two DKGs run concurrently):

* **DKG Round 1**: `<bifrost_url>/dkg/<epoch>/<threshold>/<attempt>/round1/<pool_id>.json`
* **DKG Round 2**: `<bifrost_url>/dkg/<epoch>/<threshold>/<attempt>/round2/<pool_id>.json`
* **TM proposal**: `<bifrost_url>/sign/<epoch>/tm.json` (current TM transaction and txid)
* **FROST signing**: `<bifrost_url>/sign/<epoch>/<txid>/<mode>/<attempt>/round1/<pool_id>.json` (nonce commitments), `.../round2/<pool_id>.json` (partial signatures)

Each SPO writes its own payload locally, then polls all other SPOs' endpoints until the relevant round deadline is reached. Any signed payload fetched from HTTP can later be reused on-chain as direct fault evidence.

### Authentication

Every payload published by an SPO is authenticated with a **sign-the-hash** scheme: each message type defines a deterministic **canonical byte layout** (a fixed concatenation of the message fields), and the SPO signs `SHA256(canonical_bytes)` with `bifrost_id_sk` using BIP340 Schnorr [3].

**JSON is transport only.** JSON carries the structured fields plus the 64-byte signature. The receiver reconstructs the canonical bytes from the JSON fields, computes `SHA256(canonical_bytes)`, and verifies the signature via `bifrost_id_pk` (read from the on-chain registry).

**Why sign-the-hash instead of signing JSON?** The signature must be verifiable both off-chain (SPO-to-SPO) and on-chain (misbehavior proofs via Cardano validators). Cardano validators cannot parse JSON but can verify `verifySchnorrSecp256k1Signature(bifrost_id_pk, message_hash, signature)` where `message_hash = SHA256(canonical_bytes)`. The canonical byte layout for each message type is defined in the DKG and signing sections below.

This prevents impersonation — an attacker who compromises a `bifrost_url` DNS record or HTTP server cannot produce valid payloads without the corresponding `bifrost_id_sk`.

### Failure handling

Failures are handled deterministically so that all honest SPOs converge on the same provisional and final qualified subsets.

**Round 1 non-publication**:
- If an SPO fails to publish a valid signed Round 1 payload before the deadline, that SPO is excluded from the **current attempt's provisional subset**.
- Missing Round 1 publication does **not** create a challenge and does **not** immediately create an on-chain ban.

**Round 2 missing publication**:
- If an SPO that is already in the provisional subset fails to publish a valid signed Round 2 payload before the deadline, that SPO is excluded from the final qualified subset for the current DKG/signing run.
- Missing Round 2 publication does **not** create a challenge and does **not** immediately create an on-chain ban.

**Direct faults**:
- If an SPO publishes a payload with a valid transport signature but invalid cryptographic contents, or publishes two distinct signed payloads for the same namespace, any eligible SPO may submit direct fault evidence to the appropriate authorized fault verifier policy.
- Once the resulting `FaultProof` token is consumed by `spo_bans.ak` and the ban is confirmed, future protocol runs exclude that SPO via the updated active ban list.

**Deterministic subset selection**:
- For DKG, the eligible set comes from `registration_list \ active_ban_list` at the relevant roster snapshot time.
- For TM signing, the eligible set comes from the current on-chain roster minus any active ban entries.
- In every attempt, the provisional subset is the set of SPOs that published valid Round 1 payloads before the common deadline, and the final qualified subset is the subset of those participants that also published valid Round 2 payloads.
- For a fixed DKG `(epoch, threshold-mode)`, the threshold `t` is constant across attempts.
- If the final qualified subset does not meet the active threshold, the current DKG/signing mode fails immediately when the bounded phase deadlines close, and the next lower mode starts immediately if available.

## Watchtowers

### Watchtower Architecture

Watchtowers are permissionless participants who maintain Bitcoin blockchain state on Cardano. They serve as the critical link between the Bitcoin and Cardano networks, ensuring that Bifrost has accurate, up-to-date information about the Bitcoin blockchain.
Watchtowers use Binocular, a technology stack previously created and now improved on Bifrost.

**Key Design Principles:**

* **Permissionless Participation**: Anyone can become a watchtower at any time without registration, bonding, or approval. This ensures the system cannot be censored or controlled by a small group.
* **Competitive Model**: Multiple watchtowers compete to submit the most accurate chain of blocks. If one watchtower submits invalid or stale data, others can immediately challenge with the correct chain.
* **Economic Incentives**: Watchtowers are rewarded for posting valid blocks, creating a natural incentive for honest and timely participation.

### Core Watchtower Responsibilities

1. **Monitor Bitcoin Network**: Watchtowers continuously track the Bitcoin blockchain for new blocks as they are mined.

2. **Submit Block Headers**: When new Bitcoin blocks are found, watchtowers submit the 80-byte block headers to Binocular Oracle smart contract on Cardano. These headers contain all information needed to verify Bitcoin consensus rules.

3. **Compete for Accuracy**: Multiple watchtowers naturally compete to submit the most accurate chain. If a watchtower submits headers from an invalid or weaker fork, other watchtowers can challenge by submitting the correct chain with higher cumulative proof-of-work.

4. **Maintain Oracle Liveness**: Watchtowers ensure the Oracle never becomes stale by continuously updating it with the latest Bitcoin state. This is essential for timely peg-in and peg-out processing.

### Bifrost-Specific Watchtower Duties

Beyond maintaining general Bitcoin state, watchtowers perform specialized duties for the Bifrost bridge. The architecture has the following key constraints: SPO programs have access to Cardano chain state but not to Bitcoin chain state; watchtowers have access to Bitcoin chain state but not to SPO programs or SPO private keys. Cardano serves as the shared data layer between both parties.

**Peg-in Detection and Posting**

* Monitor the Bitcoin network for peg-in transactions by scanning for OP_RETURN outputs with the `"BFR"` prefix.
* Each peg-in transaction sends BTC to a unique Taproot address ($Y_{51}$ key path for SPO sweep, $Y_{federation}$ script leaf for federation emergency sweep, or a depositor timeout script leaf for self-refund; see **Taproot address construction**) and includes an OP_RETURN output: `"BFR" || depositor_pubkey_hash (20 bytes)` (23 bytes total). The depositor_pubkey_hash is HASH160 of the depositor's Bitcoin x-only public key and is needed by SPOs to reconstruct the Taproot tweak for key-path signing. Because each peg-in goes to a unique Taproot address (derived from the depositor's pubkey hash), watchtowers cannot track peg-ins by address alone — the OP_RETURN metadata is what makes them identifiable.
* Once a peg-in transaction reaches the required confirmation threshold (100 Bitcoin blocks plus 200 minutes of Binocular challenge period), watchtowers create a PegInRequest UTxO on Cardano (peg_in.ak) by:
  * Minting a PegInRequest NFT.
  * Providing a transaction inclusion proof consisting of: the raw Bitcoin transaction data, a Merkle proof linking the transaction to the block's Merkle root, and an inclusion proof of the confirmed block in the Binocular Oracle.
  * Setting the datum with: the raw Bitcoin peg-in transaction bytes and the creator's Cardano pubkey hash (for PegInRequest closure authorization).
* The on-chain `peg_in.ak` validator verifies the Binocular inclusion proof and confirmation depth (100 Bitcoin blocks + challenge period) but does not parse the Bitcoin transaction. SPO programs parse the raw transaction off-chain to extract deposit data (txid, vout, amount, depositor pubkey hash from OP_RETURN, Taproot output key $Q$) and validate it before including the peg-in in the Treasury Movement transaction. The raw peg-in transaction is parsed on-chain only at mint time (by `bridged_asset.ak`) to extract the depositor_pubkey_hash and deposit amount. Taproot address correctness is **not** verified on-chain (Plutus V3 lacks secp256k1 point arithmetic builtins); instead, SPOs verify off-chain (see **Taproot address verification**).

**Treasury Movement Relay**

* Monitor Cardano's treasury_movement.ak for new signed Bitcoin transactions posted by SPOs.
* Pick up the serialized signed Bitcoin transaction from the UTxO datum.
* Broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.
* This is a permissionless action: any watchtower (or any user) can relay the transaction.

**Peg-out Completion (Optional)**

* Once the Treasury Movement transaction is confirmed on Bitcoin, watchtowers can complete peg-outs on Cardano by providing Binocular inclusion proofs. However, this is not exclusive to watchtowers — anyone can perform peg-out completion with the right proofs, ensuring censorship resistance.
* For peg-out completion: provide a Binocular inclusion proof showing the Treasury Movement transaction paid the correct amount to the correct Bitcoin address, burn the locked fBTC and the peg-out NFT, and return the MIN_ADA to the withdrawer.
* Peg-in completion (minting fBTC) is performed by the depositor directly, not by watchtowers — the depositor must provide their Bitcoin x-only public key and a Schnorr signature to authorize minting to their chosen Cardano address (see **bridged_asset.ak**).

**Anomaly Detection**

* Continuously verify that Treasury BTC balance matches or exceeds circulating fBTC supply.
* Alert the system if invariants are violated.
* Trigger failover mechanisms if SPO signing stalls or quorum is lost.

### Binocular Oracle

The Binocular Oracle is the on-chain component that stores and validates Bitcoin blockchain state on Cardano. It provides trustless verification without requiring trust in any external party. For complete technical details, see the [Binocular Whitepaper](https://github.com/lantr-io/binocular/blob/main/pdfs/Whitepaper.pdf) [1].

**Bitcoin Consensus Validation**
The Oracle validates all Bitcoin consensus rules directly on-chain:

* Proof-of-Work verification (block hash meets difficulty target)
* Difficulty adjustment validation (every 2016 blocks)
* Timestamp constraints (greater than median-time-past, less than 2 hours in future)
* Chain continuity (each block references valid parent)

**Fork Management**
The Oracle maintains a tree of competing Bitcoin forks and automatically selects the canonical chain based on cumulative chainwork (total proof-of-work). This mirrors exactly how Bitcoin Core selects the best chain, ensuring the Oracle always reflects Bitcoin's true state.

**Confirmation Tracking**
Blocks progress through multiple stages:

* Initially added to the forks tree when submitted
* Tracked for confirmation depth (distance from chain tip)
* Only blocks with 100+ confirmations are considered for finality

**Transaction Inclusion Proofs**
For Bifrost operations, the Oracle provides data for Watchtowers to construct proofs that:

* Prove a specific transaction exists within a confirmed block
* Prove the block is part of the confirmed chain
* Enable trustless verification of peg-in deposits and peg-out completions

### Challenge Period Mechanism

To prevent pre-computed attacks and ensure security, blocks are not immediately finalized when submitted:

1. **Submission**: A watchtower submits new Bitcoin block headers to the Oracle
2. **Challenge Window**: A 200-minute window opens during which any other watchtower can submit a competing fork with higher chainwork
3. **Resolution**: The Oracle automatically selects the chain with the highest cumulative proof-of-work
4. **Finalization**: After the challenge period expires and the block has 100+ confirmations, it becomes "confirmed" and can be used for peg-in proofs

This mechanism ensures that even if a malicious watchtower pre-computes a short fork, honest watchtowers have ample time to submit the correct chain.

### Security: 1-Honest-Watchtower Assumption

Bifrost's watchtower design relies on a minimal trust assumption: only one honest watchtower needs to exist for the system to function correctly.

**Why This Works:**

* If all active watchtowers collude to censor or submit invalid data, any user can spin up their own watchtower
* The permissionless design means no one can prevent new watchtowers from joining
* Honest watchtowers are economically incentivized to challenge invalid submissions

**Censorship Resistance:**

* A user wanting to peg-in or peg-out can always become a watchtower themselves
* They can then submit the necessary Bitcoin blocks and proofs for their own transactions
* This ensures Bifrost remains operational even in adversarial conditions
